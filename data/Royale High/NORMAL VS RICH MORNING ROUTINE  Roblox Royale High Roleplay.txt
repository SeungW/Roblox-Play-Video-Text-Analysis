Hey, my little puppies puppet girl. Here buckner video. And today I am back playing some royal high school. You guys really liked the My City Life morning routine video. So today I am doing another morning routine. I am doing a rich person versus normal person morning routine. So without further to do, let's go ahead and get started. Morning already? Well, guess it's time for another day of school. I just need to stretch. Okay, I am ready for the day. Okay, let me go make my morning cup of tea. Okay, let me grab the tea set. What flavors tea should I make today? Let's just make some standard morning lemon tea. 

Add a little splash of cream and no sugar cubes. Nothing like a good cup of tea in the morning. Okay, I should probably head over to the bathroom to start getting ready for the day. Class starts in a few hours, and I need to get dressed and stuff. Okay, let me go ahead and change into a towel. All right, time to go take a shower. All right, I think that's good. Let me turn off the water, and then let's see what's in the Royal High magazine today. A mysterious case has just been released to the public earlier today about a missing gem stolen off the crown of the most beloved and fairest queen of the kingdom, queen Barbie. 

What? Oh, my gosh. Wow. That is a crazy story. I really hope that they catch this person. Let's see how the results of the pole did. Okay, these are top voted skirts, top voted heels in the top voted makeup look. So I'll have to keep that in mind when I get ready. Okay, let me just brush my hair. There we go. I think this is a cute hairstyle today. Some simple braided pigtails. Now time to do my makeup. Here we go. Went for this nice natural look today. Now time to get dressed. Okay, I am done getting dressed. Here's my outfit today. It's just a cute little simple outfit. I have this sweater and my rainbow sneakers, and I think I am about ready now. 

I am starving. Time to get some breakfast. You head down to the castle cafe. I'm a little late, so they aren't actually serving breakfast food. I'm just going to eat a tea sandwich, and let's just get some water. My food is ready. Let me sit over here. Now let's try this tea sandwich. This is pretty good. I love PB and J. It's a pretty simple meal, but I just think it's delicious. Wash it down with some water. Okay, I'm done with breakfast. Now it's time to go take my morning stroll. I like to get some fresh air in the morning and just kind of relax and look at the pretty nature. It's very pretty around my school. Here it is. 

This is a little tent that I like to go to in my morning strolls. I like to just sit here and look out the window for a little bit. I didn't realize the time was to really be heading back. Class starts in 20 minutes, and I have a little bit of homework to finish up before I go to class. Okay. I'm back at my dorm. I just need to finish up, a little bit of homework to do, and I am done. Okay. I barely finish in time. I am going to be late for class. I really got a hurry. Okay. And I am here. Thank goodness. I was almost late to class. Time for another amazing day. 

The view is amazing as always, watching the sun rise over the city. Now time to go get my morning cup of tea. Good morning, Mary. Good morning, ma'am. Would you like your usual cup of tea today? Yes, please. All right. Coming right up. Thank you. Would you like some cream in your tea, ma'am? Yes, please. Okay. What about sugar cubes? Sure. All right. Okay. Here is your tea, ma'am. Thank you, Mary. You are excused. All right, time to go drink my tea at my bay window. 

I just love staring out of you. It's so pretty. Can life get any better than this? That tea was delicious, but I'm feeling quite hungry now. Mary? Yes, ma'am. Could you make me some breakfast? Of course. What would you like? I'm feeling like pizza today. Okay. What toppings would you like? Everything. Okay, that should be done in 30 minutes. Thank you. Pizza sounds so good right now. Okay. 

Oh, my cousin has just joined me. Okay, ma'am, your pizza is ready. And you have a friend visiting you, too. Oh, my friend is here. Hey, my maid made some pizza. Let's go eat. All right, let's go. This gourmet pizza is so good. I get pizza on the couch. Oh, no. Who cares? My maid will clean it up later. You put meat on the pizza. Is that okay? I am vegetarian. I'm sorry. The maid can just make another one. Yeah, you do whatever you want. I'm going to take a bath. All right. I'm going to go take a nice bath. My friend can do whatever she wants. Okay, I changed into a towel now. Time to enjoy a nice, relaxing bath. Let me turn on the candles. This is so nice. Life can't get any better than this. Okay, well, I think I'm about done bathing for now. 

Now, time to do my makeup and nails. I'm going to do my makeup and nails. Want to do it with me? Just a minute. Okay. Okay, let's go do our makeup and nails. Time to do my makeup for the day. Okay, I'm done with my makeup. You like my makeup? Yas, queen. Thank you. Let's do our nails. Got to paint our toenails. Do do do do. Oh, my gosh. Fire. Fire. Oh, no. Mary must have left the stove on. Oh, gosh. I think I had too much tea. But I see fire. I do, too. The man will take care of it. Okay. The fire is gone. I think Mary put out the fire. That was close. Let's finish our nails. All right. Let's finish painting our nails. We had a little interruption, but, you know, it's fine. 

My nails are looking a little chip, so I got to file them, too. I already painted my fingernails yesterday, so I don't need to do that. But no person couldn't come today, so we have to do it ourselves. I know, right? Annoying, but kind of fun. I'm going to get dressed now. Same. Okay, let's see what I have in my closet. I have nothing to wear. I guess I need to buy some new clothes. All right, time to shop for some new clothes. Let's see. What do we have here? OOH, this outfit looks really cute. I mean, it's really expensive, but I can afford it. Okay. And I'll pay for extra fast shipping, so it should get here right about now. Okay, let's go get my outfit. Hello. Thank you. Okay, now time to change. Okay, I'm done changing. And here it is. Oh, my gosh. This outfit is so pretty. Totally worth the 50,000 diamonds. 

Now, I think my friend is still getting dressed, so I'll just wait for her and I'll ask her what she thinks. Hopefully she likes it because this costs me a lot of money. Hey, do you like my outfit? Is my outfit too fancy for school? No, I love it. Thanks. Just bought it. Wow. I love your outfit. Thanks. Oh, my gosh. I didn't realize the time. We have to go to school. Yeah, we're going to be late. Oh, no. Okay, so that is it for this video. I hope you enjoyed it. Shout out to my cousin Lizzie for making a surprise appearance in this video.

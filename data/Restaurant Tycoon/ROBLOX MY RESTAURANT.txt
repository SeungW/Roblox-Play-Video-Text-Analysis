My restaurant. Big games. Big I think big games sucks because they're only supposed to make big games. Like giant survival that has big, big, giant this joke sucks. Big games. EW. Oh, my God. That actually that day. I don't know why that scared me. Hey, pregnant boy. Two to two. Welcome to my restaurant. So is it your restaurant or my restaurant? Let's get you some customers. But to your restaurant, you must open your restaurant. What? Please complete. Oh, I can't leave. Oh, he's there. He followed me over here. He's watching my every move. Guys, this is what I like to call a dangerous situation. Oh, no. When someone walks like that, you kind of want to avoid them. Oh, open. She's kind of thinking about a chair right now. Let's go inside her mind chair. Does he have a clothes on, by the way? Because it's all kind of blended. You know what I mean? Oh, I'm happy. I'm kind of thinking I just read Harry Potter. 
It's time to cook. Interact with the order sand so we can start cooking, etc. Sand. E. Can you let it burn? All right. Interact with the order sand to deliver the food. Why am I just like, what do I do? Shut up, banana. There's literally a tutorial. A tutorial where you're forced to at gunpoint by a naked man. EEE jean with her hands, though. You complete your first order. Is it my first order or your first order? Because you said my restaurant. While your customer eats, let me show you the big shop. Is it in, like, a basement where I'm never going to be able to leave? The big shop is where you will purchase. She kind of left a little bit of a fatty tip. I'm holding it with my fingers right now. Let me show you guys what would actually happen with this. You can't hold them like that. It's like, whoa. Oh, no, sister. Where do I go from here? Do I just kind of, like, kind of, like, flick it? Like, flick it off my wrist so it takes 5 seconds to cook it, but 15 seconds to clean it. 
Guys, that says a lot about society. Hey, soap. They should make it so if you do this enough, he starts violently throwing up and then dies. And then you beat the game. David. Bob Preston. Jack. I can only afford a David. He's got a new friend. I guess, technically, he doesn't really have a choice but to be my friend. Isn't that right, Paige? You work for me, so you got to be my friend. I guess this is that pregnant boy you're about to give birth. I'll be seeing you. Have a great time in my restaurant. Not have too great of a time in your restaurant, though. It's your restaurant. Goodbye. He vanishes. My character was insane the entire time. David, go do something. Take their order. We're letting in too many people. Dude, what he actually does it. Okay, got to make got to make an egg. We got to make another egg. But we don't got any more chairs. No, wait. Why do I have to give it to him? That's his job, idiot. Okay, this is getting a little bit intense. 
Okay, wait. Got to do that. Got to do that. Okay, this is actually I don't like this. Stop taking more people. You complete starting out. This is just starting. Does it get more difficult? Purchase three chairs, purchase table. I've also never worked, like, a real job in my life. I worked at Macy's, the old people store. I had two shifts and then I never came back. I never told them, and they actually never called me back. So I must have been a terrible employee. I made, like, $50 off of, like, two days at work. It was pretty cool. Do you guys remember when Chipotle what's it called when they had that E. Coli thing where Chipotle if you ate the food, there was, like, a chance that you could get a terrible stomach flu? Those are the best times. Everybody stopped going to Chipotle. There was no lines for like, a year and a half. He's going to pocket this money. I'm taking that, right? I can now hire someone to do it all for me. There. Do it. I don't got to do anything anymore. All right, I'm out of here. They should make it like all those, like, terrible tycoons where for some reason all of them have a sword. 
So you can just start slaughtering people. I can go over to someone else's restaurant and kill them and kill all their customers. Tempest, temperst, everything reminds me of him. You are a restaurant sucks. What? He left. He motivated him. Can you name your restaurant? I don't really want to see pregnant boy. Not every customer needs to know that info. What happens if you just close the store? Wait, we're open we're open belly. Does that count towards customers served? If I just kind of close it as they're going like, oh, my God, I want to own an actual restaurant so I can do that one day. They don't have, like, a restaurant rating, do they? Oh, no, you actually have to serve them. To serve them? Are you joking? This who's already due 13,000? How do I how do you hack in this game? I want to do better. Look, guys, if you're bad at something on the Internet, you can always hack. 
The game wants me to buy three chairs. Buy a table. Okay. Oh, God. Did you just hear that? One person is just going to face away. I want to see if they actually sit here. Sit down. That'd be so awkward. Just as a random dude just joining you for dinner. Look how polite they're being. There's no weapons in this, right? No, there's none. I want someone to sit here, please. Yes. Your only option no. All right, guys, I did a lot of off camera grinding, and I got $1 million. Whoops. I got to get $1 million from off camera grinding. All right, give me that. Give me that, bro. Oh, my God. You're making me buy more stuff now. You're joking me, dude, we're going to have a million people for, like, this tiny restaurant. Hey, give me that, give me that, give me that, give me that, give me that. All right, let's go to the second floor. Oh, my God. There's so many floors. I want more. More floors, more floors. 
My being abducted by aliens was happening. I got so much money, all I see is green. All right, we need more floors. Do I have to die? I can't die. I'm stuck in misery. Yeah, I can see everyone that's better than me in this world. But we got a lot of employees just sitting around right now. We have more employees than the customers. Dude, put me out of my misery. What's wrong with you? I have to leave. I have to. More floors. More. Oh, my God. Neither. I hate this. Look at that. There is nothing. I have the biggest one. All right. Just got a flex. Literally the only reason I did this is to flex. Why is nobody coming in? Because it's not open, that's why. All right, we need, like, the mega cooker. 200,000. Okay, I got about that. I'll get this. I got a little bit more money to spend on some chairs and stuff. All right, what are you guys doing over there? No kisses on the job, no workplace relationships. Stop. How do they get up to the second floor? Is there, like, a catapult that just hurls them through the window? 
There's no stairs or anything. I'll just put that there. That looks really good there, T. That goes really well right there. All right, how far away am I from being the best? So you've served 14,000 people now? It went up by a lot. I've served 42. I'm getting there. All right, guys, I've just spent 35,000 roebucks on making my own restaurant. I have just advertised it with the money. Subway. Yay. If I need a gun, I need a gun to protect my restaurant. I'm so passionate about the food industry that I got it's really my restaurant now. It's not his restaurant. You remember that guy? My restaurant. Okay, first off, that's my area. Go away. Second off, what would you like to eat? I spent 35,000 Robucks advertising this place, so surprise me. Okay. I mean, you probably want to expect this. Who just opened that? Well, we got a ghost here. 
It's her ghost. She just opened it. Hello. What would you like to eat? What just happened? You asked for a surprise. I'm going to lock my doors here. There's, like, eight things there, dude. A sub, chocolate. It took them, like, five minutes to write that here. There you go. You want chocolate? Here. There you go. Chocolate. Bro, get out of my face. Hello. What would you like to eat? No. Oh, my God. Dude, maybe I can order from her. Can I get a sub? Sorry. Give me a sub is what I meant to say. All right? Give me a sub where I'll blow your brains out. Hey, no witnesses, and he'll kill you, too. Woman you can get drinks out of there. What do you want? Oh, my God. Bro. You guys are so annoying. Just get out of here. Stop taking all my drinks, fatty. Your name's? Hank the. A very beautiful name for a very dead lady. Okay, new customer. Oh. What would you like to eat? What do you want? How come all these nudes, they just come behind the counter? 
I own the place. Don't give me that look. What do you want to eat? You're annoying. What do you want to eat? Dude, order my food. Buy. Yeah, buy from life, little rats. Oh, my. Hello. Woman what do you want to eat? You want a sub? Sandwich? There's one on the ground. There's another one on the ground. No sandwich. Tom Chad. This guy's a chad, dude, what's that noise in the background? Hey, what do you want to get back here? What do you want to eat? Take these sandwiches. Take some sandwiches. There you go. Tom Chad still has a sandwich, but stop eating that. You didn't pay for it. All right. I'm going to collapse that little idiot in my Subway. Oh, okay. A couple more people. Yep. Get in there. Get in there. Get in the subway. Poop. Oh, God. That's so Laggy. Oh, wait, we're all falling. No, I made a mistake by Subway. No. Well, it all comes crashing down. 
I didn't think it would get rid of everything. Well, guys, there's my restaurant experience. Mine. This one's mine.

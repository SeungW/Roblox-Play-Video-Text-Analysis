Hey guys, it's Krie turn back. It's at tomorrowblocks. Today we're back inside Boxburg and I'm just sleeping in my bed. It's one in the morning. I'm like, oh, shh, shh. Yeah, just watch my sleep. Yeah, I'm just sleeping like this and I'm like, ugh, I can't sleep. Why did you take effort sleep? Maybe because I need a shower. Maybe that's the reason. That probably is the reason. I'm just going to shower. Yeah. And while we're showering, guys, I'm sorry, this went everywhere. But while I'm showering, I'm going to tell you we got Merch checking this out. We got Hashtag Sys team from SIS versus Bro. Go get it linked to Bio because this was pretty awesome. I would wear it every single day. So all right, I'm done showering. I feel very clean. I don't feel very happy. 

No, I feel happy, but I'm bored. So I'm going to play some of this. My favorite computer game. It's really great. And now I feel great. I'm going to go check on my daughter. This person, I don't know her name, really. One day could we play this with Ronald? Maybe hello, mama. Maybe hello, mamay. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. No, I'm leaving. Good night. Okay. All right. Is there people standing at my door? 

Okay, view. No, I don't want people just jumping at the barrier like no, I walk herina. Karina. Karina. Karina. Alright, but there's a person there. Hide. It's two in the morning and I still can't sleep. So you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to sleep. Why is it so bright in here? I think it's because of this alarm clock. I'm pretty sure it is. That's what's making my broom bright. But I'm going to just paint it. We don't even have the painting imaging. We can't change colors. We're just painting nothing. I was like pretending to paint. I feel like an artist because I am one. 

I'm painting with nothing on the already painted picture. I'm such a good artist. All right, that is a pretty good picture picture. I could never paint that. I tried cut. Maybe I wouldn't, I don't know. I'll try it, I'll try it, I'll try it. Could be fun. Could be a complete disaster. Probably will be, but give it a shot. All right, but it's three in the morning. What are we going to do? Let's look at a window. People staring at us. There's a bike, a very random bike. And Daglo seats three in the morning. So maybe a ghost place that bike there, probably. It's so dark here. I'm using a bike at three in the morning. That's for I don't know why, but I'm using bike. 

I also place these open signs, these light up open signs so people know it's a cafe or a restaurant because it says open. A house wouldn't just have open on. It just weird. Just park your bike or your car on the side like that. And you go in. Oh, no, there's a person. There's a person. No, on my alarm. Wait, that's not my alarm. No, it isn't. It's somebody else's. I'm just going to pretend I'm making breakfast. Not like I ever went out. All right. I'm making breakfast. I'm making breakfast. Make a breakfast. Make it. Make a breakfast.

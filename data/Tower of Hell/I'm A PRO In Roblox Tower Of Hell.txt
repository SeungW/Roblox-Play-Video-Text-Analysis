As you know, I'm really good at parcourt, so I'm gonna try the Tower of Hell. And I know I'm not the best at it, but I'm gonna give it a try. Okay, this one easy. Yes. See, I am professional ride wee. I'm always remember, guys, leave a like on this if you're better than me. This guy thinks he's better than me, does he? You want some? You want some? Go on it. Let's go. Let's see what you can do. Come up here. Can't this one. We'll jump over here and not get killed? Come on. Do it. Do it, do it. It. Whoo. No. How do I fall on that one bit? This is going to be easy mode as well. See, I'm professional. You know this. You know this. Guys have the professionalness. Yeah, that's a word, by the way. No, I walked off. How? My professionalness made me fall off. That's what happened. Don't say in the comments should that I'm rubbish at this, because I'm not. You know I'm not. Don't give me that. Don't make me upset. Don't make me cry. Yes. Hang on a second. That swung round and it didn't kill her. This one's dodgy here. I can even do the first part. Okay, we're going to do it as fast as we can now. 
Elite. Why keep saying elite? Kitty, just jump. I want to see you die, too. Not just me. Oh, I tried doing quick. I've seen people doing it really quick. How do you do it so quick? Let's go. Let's go. See this? No. I made it. Yeah, I love it. Because when you drop, that's it. That's the end of it. Made up to the next one. Be proud of myself. I'm proud of myself right now. Got. Jump through the middles. Oh, my God. They're moving. Why are they moving? Oh, they're moving to my weight. Yeah, boy. Oh, this one's simples, isn't it? Look at that. Just makes it easy for me. You can actually knock everyone over or make them jump. It's really, really horrible. I've done it plenty of times. It's actually quite fun. I see people on TikTok with this game and they do it so easy. It's like it's so easy for them, and they're like all shift locked and it's insane. These people are insane. All right, we're doing well. 
I ain't doing too bad. All right, I'm not doing too bad. I'm quite high. I've never completed one of these in my life. The whole time I've ever done this, I've never completed one. No. Yes. Let me guess. Climb up here. We've done it. We've actually done it. We've gone to the top. Look at me. I am so happy that I made it to the top. And it gives me coins to ruin everyone else's life, which are actually really nice. I made it to the top. You guys are trash. Trash. So with the shop, can I run people's lives now? Hang on, where's the stuff to make people fall off? They can purchase more speed. They got ruined there once day even more. Look, they're all stuck down here. Look at these little ones. A new tick tacks. Oh, it's a new one. Oh, hello. Hello there. Is this one going to be harder because the last one was blinking easy? Yeah, it was a screenie. Can I have screeny, please? Yo. Okay, screeny. Let's go. Oh, this is a bit hard. Do these randomly generate all these? All the same, I just want to know if you could tell me because I have no idea. 
We that is evil. Oh, I see. I hate these blinking things. I did it. Oh, my God, I did it. I feel so proud of myself. My mom to be so proud of me. Mom, mum. I play robots games. Good for you, son. Good for you. She wouldn't say that, obviously. I don't know what she'll say. Whoa. I mean, she'll be happy, I guess. As long as I'm happy, I guess you'll be all right of it. Yeah. Boy. Where'd I go? Oh, nice. I got tears running down my eyes while I'm not blinking or blinking. El, I've got this. No. I was so far up. I can't believe this. I felt all the way back down. Normally cautious. So I like it when stuff ruins other people's games and you can buy them. That makes my life a lot better because all the pain I'm going through doing this yeah. To make someone else's life and pain is really good. 
Makes me happy. This is a weird bit. This bit here, you've got sort of full and then jump. Done it up. This is super hard up here. This one, this one and then this one. There we go. See? Easy. Climb over here. This is the hard one. Because when I have struggles with here, finally the pain is gone. No, I was all the way up there. That is unfair. Did you just see that? I got all the way up there. I'm actually getting better at these, to be fair, I used to be so bad at these sort of games. It all goes shift lock, shift lock, lock. Nama, nama. No shift lock here. Just bro block. There we go. Got to get this. Nice daint jump. There we go. Nice size jump into the brown section. Must bid a toilet bowl. Yes. Nothing here. We're going to get to the top of this. R1, easy. This whole walkway was the brown section. 
You might have to go on the pro ones. I'm too good for these, I think. Too good. And this one's done for. A what's happening? Why does it look like it's all got different colors? No, no. I've felt even more I didn't know where I was. I didn't look at the section. I did all right, but no, look what these people caused me. Great deal of pain. Hang on. Is this changed my jumping up. There was a different section here. Sweat. It was different before going like this. Yeah, it was different before. Was it different before? Is it because it's different colors? Because it's different colors. That's why that's why I think it was different because it it technically was different. It was a different color. And once in the brown section again, it was gone green. Like a boggy. The gun a boggy color. Yes, yes, yes. I had all my fans join me while I had my joins on. So that's why one here is screaming at me right now. I can lid the lid. It's really easy to fall this bit here, it goes so quick. No. Almost fell the way down. My eyes are burning when my eyes are just stuck open while I'm trying to do all these jumps, man's. 
Not hot. What? Okay. This game likes to troll. This game likes to trial. Can easily get to the top easily. There's no there's no point trying to stop me game. These people are so nice. You know, I've I've played in a lot of communities. Yeah. Roadblocks has got to be the best community. Even though people can say it's bad, it's not bad. Not really. You got a couple of bad apples in there. I don't think it's bad. Not really. Lovely people. Just nice to people. Well, some people you get some people that have the bad, but okay. These ones disappear like magic wands. I want to complete it. No. My eyes are burning. Please. No. I always done it. Oh, my God. This game. I always did it. I'll go back. He just jumped into it. What a dummy. He's stupid. Yes. Don't touch the glowy things. They're not good for you. Oh. What? My hand touched it. 
Everyone stuck at the beginning. I was going to jump up, but someone's going to lead the lid. We did it. We did it. Finally. Oh, we got to park or it now. It's some serious work right here. How on. Oh, my God. That's some serious stuff. All right. You gotta be careful you jump here because these blocks above, they want to kill you. Gentle, gentle. No. Nice. Always nice. I always say that. Nice. Nice toys. I don't really like to say that. And the same one is that yes, yes. I fell and everyone's like, displeased and lid to your garbage. Yes, yes, yes. This one here is evil because when you get close to this, it comes back real quick. But we get killed real quick there. So you'll be careful. This ain't even the pro one. This is just the normal one. Okay, be careful. Be careful. I'm doing well. I'm doing well. Oh, my God. I just did it. I held my breath the whole way, so my breath like I was underwater. Woohoo. We'll get to the bit where we can't actually go to other 144. 
I'm getting nervous. They're jumping around like they know the place. Oh, my God. That was well close. No, I fell. Oh, my God. I can't believe it. Can't believe we're gonna go pro game because I'm pro. Pro gamer. Yes. Yes. Can I have a look to what we can do? This is pro, so this should be harder. Way harder. This minute be harder. Is it pro? I mean, it ain't too hard. I'll say it's the same as the other one. I mean, this looks hard, but it weren't hard. We did it leaked. Pro gamer right now. Come on now. Come on. Oh, God. Okay, that's kind of weird and strange, but I did it easily. I did struggle. Oh, my God. No, I see it there. I see it there. And I was hoping that I wasn't going to touch it, and I just about touched it. 
That's evil. It is evil. I think the normal tower is just as hard as this one. I don't think there's any difference between them. If there's a difference between them, tell me, because I don't think there is. That you guys are lying about it. All right, ready? Oh, my God. Pro gamer right now. Bro something. Then someone does fog and the the trippiness. Why do this? It's ruined my life. Don't they start telling me the world's flat? Well, that actually made it easier. Jump from the top there. That was lucky I landed there because that would have been the worst day of my life. Gently does it. Gently does it. Why did I jump like that? Oh. Oof. I felt I didn't die, but I jumped right through it. I swear. The bottom changes. Does it change? Don't tell me I didn't go through this earlier. It was little bars, wasn't it? Yeah, it's changed. So it does change. I was going through some weird thing like you figured. 
Well, I didn't remember that. It does change. Ow. Don't touch the bars. It seems to hurt. Ow. Come on, Neil. You got to be nasty to me. A bit nasty. Me bro. Made it. Made it. Yeah. All this stuff will be the same. Oh, no. Hang on. The bottom half has changed, but this is the same as what it was before. It's moved up. I swear it. Yeah. Boy. I was thinking I was pro and I just felt it's meant to be nice and you could see every place, but they put the fog here just to ruin my life. Most of these people can't even get through the first part because I'm pro. You know this up. Yes. Look at that lovely jubbly. My eyes are burning, though. No, I just wipe my eyes. Yeah. Then I fall. I blame on my eyes. 
Hay fever and all that. I literally jump through as fast I could. All right, let's go back to the standard one. Where is the standard one? Just here we go back to the standard one. See what that one's like? Rings of death. Hopefully they don't change it. So I can't see nothing on here either. I can't jump that far. Oh, my God. Why are they spinning? This is the normal one. This is harder than the I can't even get past the first bit. That's the first bit of the normal one. Normal. She's stuck. Don't stop. OMG. My cat plugs on. I look stupid now. Whoa. What the? I did that super quick. Did you see that? That was pretty amazing, wasn't it? We're getting quite high up. Does it really go back down again? The blue's so bright. I just jumped and just hoped for the best. I didn't even like to think, what are you going to do here? What am I going to do? Oh, I see. 
Guess you got to watch out for these lasers. Yes. I've never been this high up. Oh, hang on. You could jump from here straight on that block. Didn't even know. Just wait. There's no point going around where you could jump on it from here. Of course you can't jump from there. Of course you can't. Why? Come on. You donut go, go, go. Increase jump time, it looks like. Makes life a lot easier. Someone's going to put that smoke on in a minute. Watch all these people climbing up. They're doing quite well. You can't be on there more in a second. It starts to wobble. Right, we're up to here. So how high we are? Okay, so quite high up. We were almost at the top. Anyway, we're have a nice day. Elite. That's what someone just said. What a lovely person. Man, I got to stop in a minute. That's a shame. I've done so well. Plus, my eyes are burning. This next part here is evil. All right. So I have to actually jump round. It's not what you think. Blinking out. I was literally on that laser. My head's going to touch that, though. Oh, okay. 
I got to be careful. Sort of jump forwards, but not touch nothing. Yes. I've done it. I got to the top, bro. I made it all the way to the top. Easy. We did it. We could look down people, and as they're down there, they could think it's raining, but it's not. They can't even relax. It's a major spin because I'm good. So when you stand against this, does it increase the time? It does look easy. Easy win for a league. This guy up. He didn't make it. Well, I hope you guys enjoyed this, like share subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next episode.

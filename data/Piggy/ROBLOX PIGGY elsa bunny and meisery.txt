What is that? Is that an ant? This is an ant. Spidella and Misery would go along very well. Let's get down to business. Once again. What's up, guys? PG. Jones, you're back again. And today we're going to be playing Piggy Winter season. And guess what? On the icon, there's a book bunny skin right here. Whistling Winter. Nice. Alliteration there. So this is basically the last Piggy update for this game. Pretty much, yeah. And then after that mayunes go work on other projects in Intercity. So I respect that. Anyway, might as well just get started on this. Oh, man, this is going to take so many hours. Once again, but oh, well. I got to get that grind, so let's do it. And we got all the stuff. 

Season eleven. Got it. Whoo. All right. Good doggy. Christmas tree undercover. Huh? So what is that? Oh, it's Elsa Bunny. I'm going to call her Elsa Bunny. Just let it go. All right? Mezzuri. measury. Is that called measury? All right. What's the journal entry? What? No, I can't see the journal entry. Why not? Okay, I'll just get these in. That's fine. I can just go get these. And especially that one. That one, too. I can't view the journal entry. And what is that? Misery. Nice. 

Please, I beg work. Please work. Yeah, baby, it worked. Okay, let's try the journal entry. Some call him The Ranger. Others call him the Lonesome Wayfarer. He appears and vanishes just like a whistle in the wind. He's been spotted everywhere from around the lab to the southern desert, apparently. Rumor has it that he saved a couple of travelers, too. They say he's looking for someone. Something or maybe someone. As long as they're not looking for me, I'm all right with not knowing. I've got the whole military doing that already. K clip. Who is Klip? To be exact. All right. This is me every single year. Now, I wonder. I want to see how I sound like whenever I do this. Oh, look. Oh, look. So, should I get there for each other? 

Just, like, just look back? Hey, you know what? Let me try doing five minutes. Oh, wow. Misery. Look at that. Oh, my word. That is what I call spreading Christmas cheer. Look at that thing. It's so colorful. It's so cool. Look at that thing. What is that? Is that an ant? This is an ant. This is a snow ant. Spidella and Misery would go along very well. Anyway, now we are going to oop, some people. I forgot about that, too. So now, look at this. Now, ain't this beautiful? I could hear Christmas music. What music is this? 

I don't know. But, hey, it's cool anyway. And what we're going to do is go get our first victim. So might as well just go get this sharky. Pretty decent jump scare, though, I must say. Now we got to go get the rest. Hold on. Let's go get the among us. We got the among us. It's great. And now, moving on for what's next, I don't even know, but let's go get that cam. Oh, that's beautiful. We got that, too. Great. And now what's next? Where's that cam? Oh, you got, like, tiny little presents, man. Oh, we are glowing, too. How about that? I wonder what that is supposed to mean. But, hey, that's cool. All right, let's go get this guy. Come on. Where do you think you're going? You can just know. Come on. Give me that bacon. What am I saying? But darn it. I forgot the run option exists. 

Who am I kidding? All right, time to move on. Where is the recipe? Infected. Like, you're doing the macarena. You're doing the macarena. I made that in such a good emo oh, man, we didn't even make it. Oh, well, that's too bad. Well, in that case, might as well go try out what's next. Oh, there it is. That's bunny alternative. Now another snow map. I know. Is this one. Let's go try out this guy. Me. Let's go try out the so, basically, bunny is now Elsa. Now I ain't that cool now might as well get started to tempo. Let's go try this out. All right, all right, all right. That jump scare is just it's so colorful. I wonder, like, does that ever do anything? 

Do I even remember it glowing? But, yeah, that's basically it. Now look at that. It's let it go. Nope. But, hey, you know, this reminds me of Elsa. This definitely reminds me of Elsa. Look at that. I forgot it's linear animations. It's really linear. Look at that. I haven't seen that in so long for oh. Whoa. This crossbow has a collision. Look at that. Not what I was expecting. Hey, let's go get our first victim. Darn it. Well, I was about to get my first victim, but now we need to go keep getting our first victim, wherever they are. Just got to go keep oofing them. Oh, how did that okay, well, at least I got my first victim, so that's nice. So on her side is ice. It's elsa, guys. 

Wow, that's such a nice skin. It's a nice alternative. Now people can talk about Elsa in the piggy community, eh? No. Give me oh, you're going to give the gas to Robbie. No, please don't do that. I don't want to get hurt. Just please don't do that. Oh, look. Queen starlight. Hey, we're both queens together. I just stood there for so long, and it was a trick. Okay, now I like the snowflakes. They do look pretty. Oh, it looks like someone left. Okay, well, I guess that's totally fine. We got to go get that queen. We have found the queen cisco roof. Yes. We have now done it. Now build mode. We got to try that doggy Christmas tree. 

Let's go try that. Okay, now what should we what should we see. Oh, look, doggy undercover. And guess what? This is the doggy map. So I feel like it fits well for the situation. You know, I haven't done this build map in a while because it's been a long time since I've done this. Okay, now play why not, player? Let's try that. Okay, we got a decent amount of people. Let's go try this. Wow. Now, ain't that beautiful? We are undercover. It's just so nice. I liked it a lot. Oh, it's even spinning, too. Look at that. Oh, I love that so much. That's such a nice detail, but yeah, nice teddy bear. OOH. It seems that this teddy bear is hold on. This teddy bear is confidential. I am going to take this for research because this is just really mysterious. 

Z does not talk. I know she doesn't, but, yeah, this teddy bear is confidential. This is what I call Area 51 material. Anyways, guys, that was Piggy, the last update of the game. Now, ain't that crazy? It's the last update. And yeah, after two years, I can't believe it's over. Never thought of that before. But hey, all things must come to an end now. They're going to be Winnie the Pooh or Dr. Seuss quotes from because since Piggy is ending. But, yeah, I am grateful for everyone in this community. I've said this before, spice, upside, downs.

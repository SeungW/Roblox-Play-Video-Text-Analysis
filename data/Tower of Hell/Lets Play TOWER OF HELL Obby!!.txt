Oh, girl. Oh, girl. Oh my God. Why is it going so fast? Okay, yeah. Wait, how is already only like, do they lower? It might have the right game. Okay, anyways hi, you guys, it's Audrey. Okay, I'm gonna just start off by saying this whole video might be pointless. Why is my hair doing that? This whole video might be pointless just because I don't even know if it's going to work out. If it does. Hello. Here's what happened really quick. Here's a life update. Actually, I'll tell you guys while I'm playing the game. We're playing Tower of Hell today. Can't guarantee it's going to go well, but I do have a lot of pent up stress. Actually, this is the last game I should be playing if that's the case. But look, when I change my scenes now, it's not even a fade. 
I changed it to cut, so it's like it's not that funny. Okay, moving on. Anyways, so here's a funny story. Here's a funny story. It's like one of those videos where, you know, it's like Minecraft Park in the background. Oh, my God. It's like the French fried one. Oh, it's like the Minecraft Park in the back. It's like the TikTok. It's TikToks. Where it's like the Minecraft Park bore in the background and then they're like, oh my God. Here's the story time of when a bully got bullied. And then it's like really dumb. No offense. Or no, or it's like the ones where it's like, oh, what is this? Oh, my God. It was like, oh, let me be your new comfort streamer. Like, okay. But yeah, so my story isn't like that. Hold on, actually, let me where am I going? Where am I actually? Oh, my God. Okay, my story starts two days ago. 
Two days. Oh, my God. Two days ago. Okay, today I'm recording this on the 30th. So I think today is a Tuesday. It started on Sunday. Okay. I was like, oh, you know what? I'm starting school this week. Spring break is almost I don't sound like that. Spring break was almost over. I was like, hey, I'm going to have quite a bit of homework starting soon because I'm in my last trimester. I've got some hard classes. What is this? Okay, it was fine. I should record some videos ahead of time so I have content for people to watch, just like this one. And it'll be fine. I'll just record like I've done for the past eight and a half years. Okay? I've been on YouTube for eight and a half years now. It's going to be my 9th year here in August. I almost said October. No. In August. Okay. I go to record. 
My computer says no. My dad went up to shower and everything. I was alone down here. I sat here for like an hour just just going through. I searched up every possible solution possible. Every possible solution possible. It's so like every single infinite solution that it needs two possible in the sentence. Okay? Get that in your head straight. I looked all over. I then had my dad come down and sit down in my what was that? I had my dad sit down in the chair and go through it all with me. It just kept saying that I needed to update my drivers or checked it. Did I just win? Oh, my God, I won. Oh, my God. There's like four of us. I didn't even notice I was getting that far. Oh, they're just wait, what? Oh, yeah. Don't speed. No, I'm not touching it. Don't worry. We're going to sit here and vibe. But why am I invisible now? 
What happened? Where did I go? Who did that? Bruh. Someone speeded it. Oh, my gosh. Two people did. Anyways, we looked through everything, everything possible. Went through all the settings. Okay, I had updated my recording software like two weeks ago. Maybe I hadn't recorded since then. Right? So I had videos ready, I updated my software, and I just hadn't recorded since then. So when I went down and recorded, said it wasn't working, we went through why did I just hear an alert noise? What in the heck today? Can I go through? What if I just touch it? Okay. That was so mean to me. Wait, why is it that is the fastest I've ever seen it out of the 
times two. What happened? What happened? It's not even going all that quickly. They've only got it at like six minutes now. Okay. Oh, my God. Do trick shot. How? Oh, no, we just got to crawl in on, like, in the corner. Point is, we figured out we tried every little thing. The last thing we had available to us was completely uninstalling OBS. That's the recording software. This was very nerve wracking for me. Very nerve wracking. But hey, I'm recording right now, do you know? So maybe it worked. We'll see once we actually go in and I have my dad edit this video. But I think I solved it, you guys. If I did. Hi. Hello. People in the future, don't die. No, if I did solve it, hello, everyone watching this video. 
Whenever this goes up, it'll probably go up tomorrow on Wednesday because, well, maybe I'll stream on Twitch, I'm not actually sure. But my biggest fear now is that it's not going to let me stream. Something always goes wrong. I know I probably forgot something all up in here, so we'll see. But how did I even regardless, we're going to rage. A tower of hell. That first one went so smoothly. And this isn't even none of these levels are even all that hard. I don't know why I'm messing up on this. I'm out of practice, okay? I would have been playing this two days ago if my recording software hadn't broken down on me. It does great with streaming and stuff. It does great. I've done recording longer than I've done streaming. And then I updated it once and they went, yeah, the whole thing is broken now. That's how it speaks to me, okay? 
That's how my recording software speaks to me. You know, it's okay now and then, guys, and then Instagram broke on me today. Don't really know what that was about, but it was kind of rude. You know, I had to uninstall Instagram and reinstall it and re log in. I can't even log back into my Radio JH Instagram yet because my dad has to send me a confirmation code and he's not home right now, okay? I'm on my own. I'm just like, oops, he can't get to his phone right now. You know how it be. So clearly technology oh, my God, it moves. Clearly technology recently has just been like, hey, no. And that is my story. I hope you guys enjoyed it. Oh, my God. What is that? What is that? What is that? Does that mean I'm invincible? No, it doesn't. 
Or does it? What is that? Lengthen as a what? Someone added another section. We have more to jump through. Are you kid who does that? Who wastes their points sabotaging other people? I've never even seen oh, my God. I've never once seen anyone do that before. Well, maybe I have, and I just tuned it out because I was so angry. That's just pure evil. Not going to lie. That is just sad. Imagine saving up all these points. It takes quite a bit of effort to get over 100 points and then just oh, my God, I can't believe that worked. Cruel. It's cruel is what it is. Okay, now we're going to focus. Okay, watch this. Okay, actually, you know what? 
I'm not going to say that because usually when I say, watch this, everything goes wrong for me. Is this the added section? Would I have one by now? Wouldn't that be so sad? I am so scared. I really don't want to die. I'm sorry. If I go, like, really? What? Oh, okay. I got it. Because I'm a pro. Just kidding. Sorry. I'm not going to jinx myself. I'm actually, like, so tense right now. And you stop saying like, okay, here we go. Here we go. Oh, my God. How did I make no, someone made it. No believe. Oh, my God. I missed it. That's two times now. That is two, I think. Here's the thing, guys. 
I think, oh, I feel so bad for this guy, but I'm going to do it. I feel like Tower of Hell took pity on me and they were listening to my story, actually. They were like, wow, that's really stressful. Here, we'll give you two wins. Even with someone sabotaging us by lengthening, it hello. Hello. Okay, we'll try this one. We'll try this one. We'll try this one. Oh, my God. Or maybe I have just like, a pro finally. Maybe I just finally had my glow up moment. You know, it happens. I finally had my okay, no, that wasn't a glow up moment. Look. Okay, guys, I don't know if you even noticed. I don't have any makeup on. I didn't get dressed. I'm actually still my PJs, aka dream hoodie and minecraft pants. What is this? What in the heck? I haven't even gotten dressed today because I was doing schoolwork all day, and then I came down here and I went, I'm going to figure out how to record again. And then I did it. 
Okay, we did it, guys. We did it. It was all because of you guys, so thank you. How do you get up that? That is so confusing. If I jump on, can I reach that second one? Hold on, we're going to try this. We're going to try this. I'm going to have a pro moment. Maybe I should just do all this. Maybe. This is embarrassing. Where was that? Yeah, let's go this way. This looks so much easier. What? How do you even mess up on that, bro? Sorry. That was so mean. Wow. Why didn't I just do that from the beginning? I literally just speed ran that. Oh, my God. What? Oh, I hate that so much. Okay, watch. Okay, that was really mean to me to say earlier. I should not have dissed that guy. I'm going to get like santa's going to be like, oh, you were good this year, and then you bullied someone in Roblox. 
It's like one of those Clickbait videos, which what the frick is that? Okay, I don't want to act. There we go. Okay. They're like it's like, oh, my God, someone bullied me in robots. Check this. No, we're going to try one more time. That's not even that hard. Look, two people have already made it to the end. This is not a hard level. Are you shooting? Shooting? Oh, my God. I'm not shooting anything. I've actually never even held a gun in my life. What the heck? How dare you? Why would you even say that? Oh, my God. Do I look, like, aggressive right now? What the heck? Don't worry. I know what they actually meant. Do not worry. I'm not like okay. No, we got this. 
Watch. Doodoo doodoodoo. Imagine dream speedrun music. Actually, maybe I'll tell my dad to edit it in. Oh, watch. We're speed running. We're speed running. I am the dream of Roblox Julia. Okay, watch this, watch this, watch this. I think this is a stopping point. Oh, my gosh. Okay. I literally okay. That looks sketchy. Hi. Hello. Oh, my God. Okay. That was incredible. That was so smooth. That was beautiful. Oh, my God. I literally dream. Okay, sorry. No, watch this, watch this, watch this. Okay. What the frick is that? What? Is this allowed? What? What is this? Oh, my God. I hate whatever this is. This is my least favorite level. How do I reach that. 
Hold on. What? How do I oh, my God. That was so stressful. Okay, okay. Can we get a third win? Can we get a third win? I swear, if she touches it don't you dare. Don't you dare, girl. Don't you dare. It's like I need to buy, like, invincibility I'm going to cry if I don't make this. Oh, my God. Get some keyboard ASMR up in here. I hate this game. Okay, watch. Oh, my God. What the frick is that? No way. Oh, my God. There's multiple levels. Are you kidding me? This should not be allowed. What even is that thing? 
I've never even seen this one. Okay. What? I keep hearing alerts even though I have them turned off right now. What is this, by the way? Follow my twitch if you aren't already. It's radio. Audrey live. Come check me out. It's really fun. Have a good time. Or just turn on notifications here, because we also oh, my God. What is that? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I actually don't know what this is. I actually can't even process what's going on. Oh, my God. What the frick? Oh, my God. I feel it slice me up. Okay, get ready, get ready, get ready. Okay, go get ready. You're ready? When do I oh, my God. This is the worst thing in existence. Go, go, go. Oh, my God. I made it. Oh, my God. How the frick do I get up here? If I fall, I will cry. 
No, I'm trying. I'm trying. I promise. I've never gotten three wins. I've never gotten three wins in a video. I've never once gotten three. This is like this is my comeback video. Thank you. Thank you for not touching it. Oh, my God. Yay. Thank you. Oh, my gosh. Thank you. I feel like I need to just, like, walk down a red carpet now. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. I'm taking my seat next to, like, a red carpet show and, like, thank you so much for having me here. Wow. It's my mother. Hi. That was me walking in. No, actually, you know what? We got to put some more effort into that. I like, come in. This is my seat. Pretend this back pillow. This is my name tag. Okay. I come in, I'm like, well, okay, maybe more like this.

We're going to end it right there. I really, really hope this video turns out some way, somehow, I'll make it work, because that is like, the best luck I've ever had.

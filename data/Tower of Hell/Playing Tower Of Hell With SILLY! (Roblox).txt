No, but it doesn't make sense because it shows me that I did make it to the red. I'm all the way back at the bottom. No, the extra gravity bounce is not very good for this level up here. I am so sorry. I take full accountability for that. It's okay. We didn't know that this level was gonna be up here. No, we did not. Oh, no. I'm just gonna reset my character before this video begins.

And don't forget to leave a like and comment down below if you enjoy videos like this, I feel as you start with pizza if you're looking to buy Robucks silly. What are you doing? What do you mean, silly? I'm moody. I can tell. You have both the plushies on your hips. Yeah, I'm moody. What do you mean? Look, I'm moody. 
I don't know. Feel like moody. Hi. How are you doing? We're going to start off by skipping this level so that we can start with a fresh one. Let's go ahead and skip that, and I will add on two minutes of extra time for us. Two minutes longer. Hale, I'm not good with hail. We got this. We're going to make it to the top, this video, and everyone's going to be super. Okay? We did the same thing there. I'm sorry. I'm giving you the wrong I'm showing you the wrong ways. I'm following you. I'm sorry. Okay. Be careful. Okay, that was very impressive. I think we showed our skills there. Okay, let's just keep going. We're going to make it to the top. Did you rush it? No, I wanted to jump after you, but I missed those wall jumps. 
I hate those wall jumps. They're my least favorite, especially when they're timed. They're so hard. Yeah, we started recording this. I should have said, let's prepare for torture, because that's what's going to happen today. Okay. No comments. No, I'm going to leave. Here we go. Hard. I know. I hate the wall. Jeff, you're making it here. We know. It's so difficult. Oh, no. That brown one up there, I thought that brown one was going to be the easy brown one, but it's not. I don't know. I didn't really have a chance to look at it because I know exactly what you just said. I didn't get a chance to try there. I would say I would give us checkpoints to make it easier, but we can't even get the checkpoint level. Like, if we make it past this purple one, then they'll give us checkpoints. 
Oh, no. Because I think you need to complete two levels to get the first checkpoint. I mean, can I just sit here and cry myself to sleep? Wait, I did we did you I did it. No way. Good job. Okay. You got this. I'm going to give us checkpoints now anyways. No. Okay. Well, that was nice. How are you today? I need a complete gist level in order for the checkpoints to work. Moody, are you using hacks? I am using hacks, and I'm going to give us another hack. It's called invincibility because this brown one literally is just all laser walls, and I don't know if I like that. Laser walls? Yeah, but now we can walk through them because we all have invincibility. Okay, well, can I get invincibility from this level? Because it's kind of is there anything maybe you think would help you get to the next level? 
I can always get it. Oh, wait, I might have an idea. Now that you're mentioning it. What is it? Let me see. Trying to get up to this next level. Why isn't warning make me warn like this? Because you actually helped me there. Because I couldn't jump correctly. Okay, well, good job. You're doing well. I think we're going to make it to the top in, like, 2 seconds now that we have a bunch of hacks. Oh, my gosh. Yes, I'm doing it. Okay, now you just need to make it past that one, which should be really easy because we have invincibility, and then you get the next checkpoint. Oh, my gosh. I'm doing it. I'm literally doing this. Oh, yes. This is going to be amazing. I think we're going to be able to do another tower after this since we're going to make it so fast. Oh, my gosh, I'm going to fall down. Oh, wrong way. No worries. If you fall down, it's fine. You got the checkpoint. Oh, I did. 
I'm so happy with that. Thank you so much. Yeah, I love the checkpoints. I think the easiest way to actually get to the top is checkpoints and invisibility. I agree. What is with these wall jumps right here? They just get bigger and bigger. Yeah, this red one up here is very dangerous. Oh, but isn't red supposed to be good for you? Red is very good, but it also hates me for good reasons. Oh, no, wait, I didn't hit it. Or did I? I think I did. You may have got it. Did I? No. Wait, I had to walk anyways to go up there because you fell down to there. No, but it doesn't make sense because it shows me that I did make it to the red. I'm on the way back at the bottom. No, the extra gravity bounce is not very good for this level up here. I am so sorry. I take full accountability for that. It's okay. We didn't know that this level was going to be up here. 
No, we did not. Oh, no. I'm just going to reset my character. Yeah, that's what I did. Oh, my gosh, this is hard. No, this is actually helping me with the walls, to be honest. Oh, you know, this level's fine. The blue one, I just hit my head on the top. Oh, no. Really? I forgot to jump there. No yeah, you get past there, and then you're going to hit your head a little bit. Yeah, that's a bit of an issue. I don't know what to say. We got this. We're going to figure it out somehow. That is ruin it for us. We got to do everything all over again. I'm having a hard time over here. Is there no extra bounce that we can purchase? I don't double jumps. You can actually purchase double jumps. Okay, I got double jumps. Oh, my gosh. That literally would have been impossible. Are you okay? No, I'm an Ivy. 
I'm not able to do this last bit. For some reason, I just did it, but now I can't anymore. Well, now you have double jumps, so you should be able to double jump if needed. Okay. You just jump over the lawn. Thank you so much. And then this last one should be super easy now because you can just double jump up here. Oh, my gosh, I'm scared. I'm scared of Moody. You got this. You're almost at the top. Go, go, go. Wait, I can double jump here. Yeah, it's so easy. Oh, God, I did it. No, we did it. Now let's touch this door right here. Oh, my God. I mean, electric. Wait, did you touch it? Okay. There you go. I was like, no, it's going to hurt this time before you end up touching it. No, I didn't. It's okay. And I still get your points if you skip the level. I don't know. Wait. I thought I could double jump onto the other platform. If we could jump on each other's head, we probably would be able to. Moody, jump on my head. 
I can't. Oh, my gosh. This is sad. I see what we did. We just went through this. I am proud of us. Yeah. We made it all the way to the top with no cheats, right? No cheats. No cheats. I just want to say, this level right here used to be so easy. Okay. It's a little difficult, but after you understand how to do it, it's easy. But for some reason, Tower of Hell changed. Its, like, gravity or something in it. Okay. Okay. So basically what you're supposed to do is, like, you have to get on like this. I don't know. You have to get, like, on the side of it. And, like, for some reason, it pushes me all the time now, and I just can never do this level. Wait, how does this even work? And I'm get it. So you're supposed to get up on top of here, but, like, wait. Yeah, see, you start pushing me. It pushes me off. I don't even move. It didn't used to do that. It pushes me off. Oh, no. Well, it pushes me off the edge because I fell down wheaty. And so every time I see this level, I normally skip the level. 
Every viewer knows that I skip the level. They see this because it doesn't work anymore for me. Wait, what? It just works perfectly fine. There. You're welcome. Now it looks like I'm lying about it. No, you're not lying about it. Oh, it's pushing me. It's pushing me. This is why I can't do this level. And this is why I think we should give up. And I don't think we're going to pass this level. I mean, we passed the last level and I'm pretty proud of us for that. So I'll go with whatever. I think that's enough. Then we should have here before we get too deep into unveiling like 3000 times. Oh, my gosh. Well, did you have fun today? It's ourville yes, I had so much fun. Especially because you are here. Hello. Yeah, I know. I'm pretty awesome.

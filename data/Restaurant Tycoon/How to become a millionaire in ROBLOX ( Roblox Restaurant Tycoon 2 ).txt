
Hi, guys. It's Elite, and I'm back with another video on Roadblocks. And this one, it's exactly the same as the last one. Restaurant tycoon. And this is where you got to try and build your restaurant up, make a bit of money. I've already made quite a bit of money from my restaurant. I just need to sort it out. I've just increased the size of it on the last video, so I need to now sort it out to get my chefs back, all my workers. It's start getting people back in and start making some more money. So we're going to go in build mode. If any of you guys are not a subscriber yet, hit that subscribe button and that little bell for notifications and drop a like on the video if you really liked it. Let's start building. Let's start building. I've got some tables. These are oneners. Oh, no, these are twos. It seems like there's, like, a real big line, but I have a welcome sign just here and a fish tank over here. 

Oh, that's the wrong way. Hang on. Got to remove that and redo it. Field fish tank. All right. That's the way it's meant to be. Find an emo. That's right. Big table. We kept four people around this. Can't we so put there then? I can put no one there and no one there and do the same stuff. So all I'm thinking is, how many people can I get in it, if that makes sense. That's all I'm thinking. Rotate. My God. Yeah. We fitting some people in here. I've got a pot here I don't really want. I'm gonna put a table there, and that in the corner over there. There we go. Looking good. Finish. Let's get some workers in. 

Start work. Start work. How much stuff have I got? Italian Chef. I've got loads of chefs. Didn't realize how much stuff I had. Barista could go there. Look. All right. My ratings have gone up quite a lot, actually. Speedy service is going up because I've only just restarted it. So all these people are waiting on food. Look how many people there is. Let me go. Build mode. Build chairs. Do these chairs, because I know which way they're going. Two tables. Just one. Just one table, and you go buy another one. Let's go buy another one and buy one more that I just missed. Purchase that one. There we go. Finish. Finish. There we go. 

I start making some money now. Starting to rake it in. Oh, payment it. Bang. Thank you very much. I start getting some payments in. More and more people coming. Wow. They can just walk in any way. So I can have actually all this against each other and it wouldn't matter. So I can have tables and stuff in between. This what sounds rancid, but I could be making some serious money. Yeah, I might try that. I might try it. Yeah. More people coming. In, come in, come in. Come sit down. Come take a seat so I can take your money. Ha. Because see what the other people's places are like. Oh, click the dishes. What the hell? Clicking dishes for them. Let me say hi, how's it going? Really big store. 

Look at the size of it. It's like Ikea in it. That's what they're trying to say. I've got coffees drinks going on. I want to change these cookers later on, make them look really nice. Oh, click them. Click this dankness money because I want all the money. They're going through the tables. Look at them. They don't live in this dimension. They're like ghosts. Jesus and ninja just come in, you know. I'm a black belting karate. Wow, the fish tank is great. Such a goodbye. The fishes don't even move, look. Yeah, I'm making more money. I'm sorry. I'm walking all over your dishes. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm walking on your stuff. Oh, my God. This guy's having some puke again. That guy's having some turds there. Look nice. He's having some flat pizza thing. Don't even know what that is. 

It's dipping in sauce. Oh, she's walking through as well. Burger, fish and chips, I think. Oh, some more money over there. Some more money. Just mine's in my house. We're both jumping. Yay. Hopefully enjoy it. You get some diamonds. That's right. Dancing. What are you dancing about? I don't hear no music. I got no music on. Right this way is the ghost. They can just walk right through tables. I don't even know how they do it. It's like some freaky stuff going on here. People send me a friend's request. 

All right, so we need more tables. These bad boys here, when I finish climbing on them like a monkey, 1234. Only quite a few of these ends. I'll get ten of these, just a bit. I'll get a couple more seats. More people, eh? I shall jump place doing. Yeah, speedy service. More people come in. So more people in. More people means more money. 121-21-2120. No, I put a table down when I shouldn't have. Only 12345. And then six. That's how much I need. Six, seven, eight. 

Finish, finish. Take up money. Take. I need eight. HS. HS. Remember HS. 1234-5678. That's right. I'll get some more chairs. Want to pack my place out there? Go and I'll get some more tables. I think one more table. One couple of these bad boys and two of them just in cases. Go back. Is there any more money anywhere? Oh, there is over there, look. I'll see it, I'll see it's. Mine, it's mine like that. There's a couple here like that. I need more. 

Put that one there and that one there. And I'll put this one just here so then I can put the chair there and someone can sit there by itself. I mean, if someone wants to sit by theirself, they can I guess. Munch out by theirself, eating on some tuna fish. Right back. See how much money I've made. Oh, there's a lot. I went away for just five minutes, go for a whiz and I'm back. I'm making serious dough. I thought it mattered about having these spaces because they need to get in, but they don't. They just walk through the tables and get to the table. So it doesn't actually matter. It really doesn't matter. It's got a drive through and everything. Wow, this one looks so cool. So they're doing a bit different to me. They're doing it like this, and I don't like that. I want to do it just to get as much as possible. I like the front space at the front, though. That's really cool. 

And then there's a drive through. Really want to drive through. So I need to make some dough. Oh, that's it. Right. So what I need to do is increase my entertainment and design, and that will increase the amount of people coming in. So, yeah, so I need to go here. Maximize profits. Maximize profits, my friends. You got to maximize the profits. All right. I like the bamboo and I like the other things. I think I'll get some of these flowers. Purchase them. Purchase them. I'll get some stuff up here. Get one of these radios as well. Cheerful radio. It must make him a bit more happier having that. And I'll get a bin. 

I'll increase my chairs or increase them. And I got to get loads of them. Yep. All right. Small tables, a couple of big tables. One, two, couple of these tables and then a couple of small there we go. Got well enough stuff now to increase my profits 400 fold. Oh, there's more money now. More money in here. Look, I'll close that. There we go. Money, money. Give me the money. All right, now put that over here, then. It doesn't matter too much. Where can I put this bin I'll just put there? Why not a table there? It doesn't look nice, but there is a reason. There is a reason. I'm trying to increase profits by increasing the amount of people I can have and the amount of tables that I have, if that makes sense to anyone. 

Any of you guys, click on it to play some epic music. It's nice. Number four or a table? Four. Number one. Look at that. I'm trying to increase the profits as much as possible. There we go. That should increase that should increase my popularity and design and stuff. Not even the design is these bits here, but, I mean, it might increase the amount of money I make and how many people come in, so I'm hoping it does, actually. Hoping. Let's have a look, see what my things are. It's gone up. Entertainment's gone up, designs gone up. So, yeah, all right. There's a lot of money to be collected now. BOP, BOP. That's how much money we got made it black. There's a light here. 

I'll put that there. I'll put that light over here. DJ me. DJ, my boy. So we're going to put that actually just there. It looks very crowded, but honestly, it should work. Alright guys, like Share Subscribe, I hope you enjoyed it. And I'll see you guys in the next episode.

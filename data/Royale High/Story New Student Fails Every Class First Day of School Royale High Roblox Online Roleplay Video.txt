Yes. I'm so happy you are here. I hope you enjoy this Royal High role play video with me. Cookies. Rossi hee. Hello, everybody. My name is Ally, and it's my first day at Royal High. Oh, is this a new student? Her name is Perry. Maybe I won't be so alone here on my first day. I'm really excited. People often make fun of me because I carry around a gummy bear. Even though I'm not supposed to like gummy bears anymore, I still do. They make me so happy, even though oh, I'm no longer a child. This is it a brand new day. I can't wait to go in. Hopefully the students are nice to me here at this school. A diamond. Of course, there's school royalty. I hope. People are a lot nicer to me here. And don't bully me. I'm going to go upstairs and check into my dorm and get into my comfiest pajamas. I've got a big day tomorrow. Oh, there's Perry. I wonder if maybe I can bunk with her. Perry, wait. Perry. Perry, wait for me. She's going up to the castle dorms. Perry, wait. There's a diamond. And there's another diamond behind the curtain. Wait, Perry. Hey. Hi. 

Do you want to be dorm buddies? We can room together. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Thank you so much. Let me just do something. She's changing her look. We have, like, the same shoes on. I'm so excited. Maybe this will be the best school year ever. And I won't be alone this time. So where's your doormat? Okay, so this one? Yes. We get to move in. I can go in now. This place is beautiful. Oh, I'm so happy. All right. She already picked her bedroom. I guess I'll claim this bedroom for my own. Perry changed her look already. She's so cool. Maybe she can teach me a thing or two about fashion. This place is beautiful. I know. I have never gone to such a beautiful school before. I'm going to go check out my room. Look at how beautiful this room is. It's almost as big as the whole entire dorm itself. I can't believe this is all just for me. Look at the ceiling. This is the perfect desk for me to do my homework. I've got two chairs over here for Perry and I to hang out. 

There's a diamond. And my bed and my dressing area. I'm so excited. I better get into bed right now. I've got a big day tomorrow. Better get into my pajamas. Big day tomorrow. Good night. Good morning. It's my first day of school. I'm so excited. Perry. Hey. Hey. Did I did I oversleep? Bumps into the thingy? My bobber. Ouchy. Is she okay? Did she bump into this arch that's in my room, by the way? You did oversleep? Oh, no. We are late. I need to get dressed for class. Dye's hair. Okay, I'm all dressed for school. Perry, are you ready? I'm ready for class. Same. My outfit. What happened? Oh, no. She's got to change again. Don't worry. Little gummy bear will be going soon. Guess this gives me time to do my hair. Okay. Now I'm ready. 

Cool. Baking class. Oh, no. I skipped baking. We're skipping class. I'm skipping class on my first day? This can't be good. I was, but I skipped on accident. Well, maybe we can go to our lockers and we can have them buy each other. Sure. Okay, good. At least we can do something. I feel so bad for being late on my first day. I'll let Perry pick where our locker should be. What? What is it? What's wrong? Something is up with this dorm room. No. My outfit again. Her outfit keeps changing. There's another girl over here. Ashy, aka. Ash for short. Neither one of us had breakfast. We skipped class. This day is going horrible so far. Perry, we got an F. The teacher knows that we're skipping. Leo is cute. Help. Hi. Hi. What? You are cute. Thanks. Come. Okay. Where are they going? Wait. Is she really just going to leave me here on my first day? Perry wouldn't do that, would she? Please, Perry, don't do that to me. 

Please. I'm sorry. I already have a roommate. See? I'm her roommate. Please. But you can come in. Oh, no. Her outfit changed again. Did he go in? I think he went into his dorm. Perry, I think we should leave. I think we should go to class. Thank you for not rooming with him. But he's right there. Oh, no. We all got f's. There's a cookie fan. Wait, she's going in? Perry, wait. I'm into ouch. Perry, are you okay? Yes. Yeah. Perry, I think we should go to class. Don't you think we should? Well, fine. Oop, pop the bubbles. This is my first day, and I haven't even gone to one class. Oh, I'm scared my teachers will hate me. Perry? Perry, where are you? Is she in her room? No, she locked. Oh, wait. Her door is open. Perry? Perry? She's not in here. I don't know where she went. She's not in our dorm. Should I go to class? But then that means I hit the face of the teachers. Here's somebody. Sammy. No. She's running. There's somebody down there. Wait. Perry, is that you? Oh, wait. 

Somebody who keeps changing. They keep changing their outfit. There they go. Danny is cute. She said, you are not cute. That's so mean. Why would she say that to her? It makes me want to cry. That is mean. Oh, maybe I shouldn't have said that. Maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved. Everyone's leaving. I don't even know where to go. I need to find Perry. Wait. Here's Leila. Oh, there she is. Perry. She's an A student. Oh, she's got to go. Layla, are you ready for class? She should meet Perry and I there. Can we share a dorm, too? I would love to. Share a dorm, but I'm actually sharing with Perry right now. And she's been really nice to me. Oh, no. I got another F for the day. Wait a minute. Where did Leila go? Why do I keep losing everybody? There she is. AW. Someone moved in with you. I really wanted to be your roommate. Here's a new friend. Hi. This is Scarlet. She's sweet, shy, god's daughter. Warning, don't touch my ears. Scared of the dark. And childish. I'm childish, too. Well, at least that's what everybody tells me. Just because I have a Gummy Bear, are you going to save for the dance? 

Wait a minute. Is the dance tonight? Yep. Yep. I know, right? I love the dance. Yay. So, what are we going to wear? I decay. Probably something cute. Well, let's go get ready. I'll probably wear a crown. I'm lazy. Yeah. Lol. The dance starts at 08:00 p.m.. There's no time. They're getting dressed. Look at everybody. The ball is starting soon. Would you like to be announced in a formal fashion at the ball? I don't know. Do I want to? I mean, I am a new student. Come on. I'm not even dressed. Wait. Just a little bit of some makeup. Just a little bit. Wait. Leila, where did you go? Layla, wait. It's Alice. I'm a crystal wolf. Love to have friends. Oh, she can be my friend. But wait. Where's Layla? At Leila. She's showering. Okay. I'm going to shower in here, too. Okay. A little shampoo. I'm going to wash my hair. I'm so excited for this dance. Little conditioner, lufa. Okay, dry off. Put the used towels here. Look at Scarlet. She looks so beautiful. You don't need to change. 
 
I don't transform into evening. There we go. I feel like a princess. I don't know how it's possible, but I feel amazing. Maybe it's because of all the friends that I've made. Where are my friends?

Everyone's coming in. It's me. Oh, I did a backflip. I walked in backwards. Look at how amazing everybody looks. Oh, she fell. Oh, she's okay. 

Scarlet's okay. The doors have closed. Everyone has arrived. Now let the dancing and festivities begin. Yay. What an entrance. That was amazing. Stop private chatting me. This is going to be great. Yeah. There's Leila. All right, let's go in. There's a butler. There's actually a butler walking around. I can't believe it. This school is so fancy. Care to dance with me? Certainly. Oh, that was a good dance. But I'm not so good at dancing, though. Thanks. I think you did better. Is there food at the dance too? I'm very hungry. I think so. Yes. Food? Yes. We have to find some food. Maybe I can find one of those butlers. Oh, there's a butler right here. Pastry chef Ash. I'll take something. Ash. I was feeling upset this morning until I walked into the Royal kitchen and started whipping up these blueberry scones. You can taste the fluffy bread tart. Blueberries. Take one.

We're on day three of opening Paul's pasta, and I think we're doing pretty good. Let's go. Look at Amira's. Let's see if she has any workers, or is she just a worker herself? Hey, there. Hello. Hey. So I could just chill. I got people working. What is wrong with your arm? I don't know, man. That is okay. You've been cutting too much onion with your left arm. Yeah.

Come on, get in. All right, let's see here. Expand, plot. We'll buy it. Wow. Have you seen my restaurant? So much bigger than yours. You have a tiny PewDie restaurant. Oh, yeah, me? 
All right. How do you have so much money already? That's impossible. It's because I got people working for me. How did you get so much people working for you if you only been playing for so long? Something's not right here, Paul. It's right. I need more tables. I think I need more tables. We're going to make ours really fancy, okay? Because when you eat noodles, you got to eat fancy noodles. You got to eat some good noodles. Here. Look at that. Wow. This is going to be amazing. It's going to look nice. Every guy is definitely going to lose, that's for sure. Let's go back to our restaurant. Oh, can I bite? I can buy more. More kitchen and order steak. That was amazing. Get that cash. Yeah, get that cash. We got to have a fancy corn over here. Oh, it's getting huge. Okay, I will help you cook, sir. I will help you cook. Let's do this. Come on. Come on. You got to catch up on these orders. 
You're too slow. You need to work harder. Look, I have to cut for you now. I have to do this. This should not be my job. How do you have so many workers made that's impossible? Because I'm the best. I mean, everybody wants noodles. That's why you should have made your restaurant about noodles. Well, I have pizza, and I have spaghetti. Okay, I think we need another chef in here because this guy is getting behind on orders. He is to cook clarke. Oh, my gosh. All right, guys, I'm doing pretty good. Look at all these happy customers. I got my chefs to actually cook now. So we've got two chefs cooking and wine waiter doing his job over there. And now I noticed you can actually get little new desserts and stuff, so oh, look at that. Onion rings. That's pretty good. I'll take it. And also I got spaghetti bolognese. That sounds pretty good. I hope I can make that. Let's see if I can make that. 
No, I don't want to make a cheeseburger. I want to make baloney. Order spaghetti. Spaghetti is what you need. I don't want anything else ordered, guys. Only order spaghetti. Spaghetti. Spaghetti. Yes. Go. You will have spaghetti. Spaghetti. That's what you're going to have. No, not the onion rings. Spaghetti. I'm not taking your order. You spaghetti, sir. Spaghetti. We have spaghetti.

You can have a table for two as long as it's spaghetti. Come on. All right, here we have spaghetti for dinner, spaghetti for lunch, and spaghetti for breakfast. The spaghetti for anything you want. What would you like? What would you like? Spaghetti. No, I don't want a cheeseburger. Get that cheeseburger out of there. No cheeseburger. No cheeseburger. Wow. Why am I so fast? All right. Yes. Eat the spaghetti with a spoon. That's not okay. That's fine. Yay. Day Six all right, guys, this is working out pretty good. All we serve here are now spaghetti. That's all we're serving. Spaghetti? Yes, spaghetti. Very nice. Very nice. All right, let's go check on amira and see how she's doing, because I'm doing pretty great over here. 
Everything is doing by itself. Let's go check on her. Yeah, yeah. Hey, there. Oh, money. I'll take it. Nice. All right, guys, I have some bad news. Our competition is actually pretty good. You guys need to work harder. Faster. You need to work faster. You need to work faster. You need to take orders faster. Go faster. Move faster. Quickly. Run. You go sit down. Go eat quickly. Go. Shoot. Come on. Go in there. Yeah. See you. All right, I think it's time to expand. Maybe I hire another person. Let's see. All right. Be right back. I'm gonna try and make a fix this place up and make it pretty. All right, guys. So it's day number twelve, and look at my restaurant. 
This is Paul's pasta restaurant. Everybody eats noodles. Hey, you go faster, you go faster. Everybody used to work faster. Look at these hungry customers. My restaurant is doing amazing. It is huge now. And the goal here is to make it much better than Mira, and I think it's doing pretty good. I want to make a two story, though, because I saw Tycoon two story restaurant. I want two story, guys. So we got to keep working hard and get that two story. All right, guys, faster. Work faster. We have a lot of customers. Look, I have to take these people's. Order, cook quickly, cook. Go, go. We need more money. I want more money. All right, guys, now it's day 20, and look at this. I expended it even more. I have even more tables, even more customers, and I'm hopping all over them. I love it. So much cash is coming in. 
All right. And look at that. I got lasagna, and I got ice cream. I love ice cream. And even though it's a noodle store, I want to serve ice cream because I feel like it. Anyways, the next upgrade we got to do is second floor. This is what I want. That will definitely put me on top, and I will make it better definitely. Than Amira. Let's go. Look at Amira. Hey, Amira. Hey, Palm. Just whoa. You got some different color tables. What the heck? Yes, I see them in the store. Only special restaurants get it. Well, my restaurant is special. Well, whatever. Mine is bigger. Much bigger and much more customers. So I think I'm doing better. Mine's more personal. Yeah, well, it's about the money, Mira. And everybody loves my spaghetti and lasagna. Now let's add that second floor. 
All right, I just bought it. Let's take a look at it. Oh, look at that. Whoa. Mira, come look outside. It's amazing. Oh, my gosh. Come look outside. Look at that. Whoa. How did you do that? A lot of work and dedication gets you a second floor of me. It costed a lot of money. What? Yeah, I want to have the stairs now, but yeah, I need to get back to work. There's a lot of customers that all want that spaghetti. Jeez. Oh, look at that. Eight people. You've never seen that? And so I will buy your stairs, and I will buy your walls. Yes, I will buy bye bye, bye bye bye. I will buy these. What? Okay, this is going to be real fun. All right, we need to change some things in here. 
Stairs. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What do I put him? I want to put him right right about here. All right, looper slooper upstairs. Whoa. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You know what? You know what? I want to take this out. Look at that. Okay, guys, it's back. Open for business. And now let me show you around. I am done. It took me a while. I am not completely done. But it looks pretty nice here. We have a new kitchen. It's right here on this corner. And I couldn't move the ordering station, so it's still right here. And we have a bunch of tables, and we also have the upstairs. Now let's go upstairs and see what we got. I don't know how these people went through. What? I think I have a little flaw design here. I cannot go upstairs. Okay. All right. 
I want to have to fix that. Look at all these nice tables up there and here. I can see everything from up here. It's amazing. All right, let me try and go down. Actually, I left a little hole right here if I ever wanted to fall down. Wait a minute. That's your car? Yep. Amira, how did you get a car? I worked for it. I got a jeep. I want a car. Take me to the car place. I want one. Yay. I'm running in the engine. You ran into a tree, Amira. I don't think you should get a license. Amira, you ran into a tree. As soon as you get whatever you want to go to the vehicle shop or not? Yeah, right here. Yeah, I see it. Let's go. Oh, yeah. It looks like a sports car. Mustang. It looks like a Mini Cooper and Jeep or some SUV. I have enough. I have plenty for sports cars, so I'm going to go with the sports car. 
Okay, I get rid of sports car. Amira, I'm going to crash it to you. This is not restaurant tycoon anymore. This is run over Amira tycoon. My hair is sticking out of the hood. But that's okay. I'm getting out of here. I'm going back to my restaurant. Why am I climbing up? Hey, Paul, I don't think you should have a driver's license. There's a pole in your car. We'll just leave it there. Let me fix this. Okay? I want to fix this restaurant because apparently you can't go upstairs. Okay. They're floating up, boys. The chef system. We're all floating up. 
That's hilarious. Oh, my that's funny. Okay, guys, I'm going to need a lot more employees, but my noodle restaurant has got to be the best one. I mean, look at this. Oh, my gosh. Maybe I need some decorations, because hers does look pretty good with the colors, but it is tiny. It's a tiny shop. Amira, what is wrong with your shop? It's so small. I'm going to upgrade. Okay? Just give me a little gosh. Well, I think the challenge is over now, and I think guys, I think I win. I got two story Paul's past that two story restaurant. I don't think he can win anyways. Have I not had the mic forever? Sorry, guys. The sound is probably not so great until now. It's probably a little bit better anyways. I think I win this one, Amira. And you did something. 
You did something weird. I know it. We're playing the same amount of time and you just got a bunch of, like, chest of stuff. It's not fair. Well, Amira, maybe you should play a little bit better because I think I did pretty good. I think you cheated. I did no such thing. There's no such thing as cheating. How am I going to cheat? Okay, cheat. I'm just really good. You hacked it. I'm just really good at my job. I think I win. You guys comment down below. You guys decide. Really? You guys are going to decide? I think you cheated. I did no such thing. I don't know how to cheat, okay? I'm a noob at Roblox, remember? I'm a noob. Exactly. So how did you get everything? Because, Amira, obviously you're more of a noob than me. Anyway, I will see you guys later. Peace.

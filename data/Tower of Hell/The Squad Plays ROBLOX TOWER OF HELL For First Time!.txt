Okay, so this is called the filter. All right. What? Oh, my gosh. This looks hard, actually. Oh, wait. I'm making it. Hey, it is kind of easy. This is so hard. Hey, I'm actually doing good. Hold on. Shut up. Good. Everyone distracts Zach whenever he's, like, doing good. He's going to get back up there, though. I might pass red. No. No way. No way. This is impossible. I fell good. I almost went to purple.

Temper 2 million pieceless. No. Zack. Zack. I can't beat this. With my muscles. I should use money. Money? What do you look like? I don't even like oh, my gosh. She has Bernie. Why are you going to buy your way to the top? Do it. Okay. Like, one free ride, please. She just starts floating up there. 
If you did that, I'd be really confused. All right, listen. Next round, let's do this. No one cares. I do. I'm going to be never mind. No one cares about you, Zack. Yeah, well, no one cares about you, all right? What? Zack get distracted by my money. My money. I don't care about your money. Because you know what? Sometimes in life, money doesn't bring happiness. It sure does buy a lot of food. And that counts as happy with her, right? I'm making it. You guys all suck. Are you kidding me? Look how far up he is. I made it first. What, though? How did you do that? Do we like teleport? He's cheating, guys. I actually broke my mouth during that held up.

We got a reset. VR v, guys. Okay, so we're back, no thanks to Drake. Oh, my God. You know what, guys was Drake? No. All right, shut up. Listen, I cannot get through with money. Then I'll try to get through by being Zach. 
Oh, my because you win every round. Somehow, Alex, there can only be one Zack. You know how I always win? How? Don't worry. I'm going to build my own way up. See you guys. Wait, why is he twice the most dude, you are so annoying. Zacker guys, we might have an easy one. Finally. Look, you know what? Just because I think it's easy, I'm going to quickly add more time for us. Where's the time? I need more time. Yes, we need a lot more time on this. Okay, yes. This actually is really easy. It's just a walk. Easy as you think. It's definitely easy. If anyone doesn't make the first round, you all suck so bad. Move, light. This one is hard. Move, light. Get out of my way. It's hard. Dude, shut up. You shut up, light. Jake no. 
You fell. Oh, hey. I'm at purple. Me, too. Doesn't matter. I'm in a league. Jade. Oh, my God. The first time I make it to the second level, I die. I'm done. She's done. That coil is op. No, it's not. He's lying. Maybe the purple coil everyone buys. You guys can't stop me still. I will beat you all to the top. Are you serious? To make green? You guys, I hate you. I hate you. Okay, guys, we're totally not cheating anymore. 
This is a legit level, all right? This is very legit. No, truth, obviously. Of course it's legit. I'll put on checkpoints for us so we don't have to start over each time. How's that sound? Yes. Checkpoints, please. So, guys, if you die, but you made it to a certain point, it will respawn you at that level. You're at I get I'm at Pink now, so I have my checkpoint here. If I die. Watch. If I die right here look at that. I'm going to be back at Pink. Who cares? Loser. I'm in red. Shut up. How is he already there? I'm at brown. Oh, my gosh. That is hard. I think I made another of your poop jade letting you know that. Yeah, well, I like to see you actually make it past the pink part in this level. Charlie, we can't even get past Brow. Listen, I'm taking my time. I'm trying to make sure you all feel good about yourselves before I slaughter you all. 
We love to see it. We love to. Come on, Charlie. It's true. This is actually really hard. Why did we decide to play this whole you skip it. Skip it's. Your idea. This wasn't my idea. That fans asked us to yeah, get a point. I blame them. Yeah, I blame them, too. Yeah. Why? I'm unsubscribing from our fans because I'm not afraid to go back to jail. Oh, no. It sounds like I'd be careful if I were you. I feel like I should. Come on, Alex. Just dance with me. This is too hard. I made it. I made it to red. Jake, you suck. You suck. No, I made it to pink. Oh, my gosh. 
I'm back in red. Wait. I had a checkpoint because I got the checkpoint thing for us. I'm going to cheat to win this. I don't care from cheating. I will win. Give up. Two minutes left. You win with no honor. I don't care if I have no honor. What's honor without wins? I win the other way. Why? Without honor? Yeah, you did it without honor. So what? You're dishonored to freak who just won. Yeah, that's right. Me. And now time is cheating, and you're just honored, and no one likes you. Now you're shunned. All right, everyone, listen up. I'm going to lead you to victory through this map. And we have to do it fair and square. All right? Sounds good. What? Did you buy those sheets? Always. When? Charlie? Oh, yeah, by the way, I turn on Vincibility. You can't die anymore.

Totally legitimate. Yeah. Non invincible. In the middle of this light. What what did you say about me? Charlie. Charlie out. I don't even know what I did in jail. I'm queen there, all right? Never mess with Charlie. Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry. Queen of the prison underground cell prison world oh, yeah guys, be careful. 
The lasers. Remember, guys, invisibility is totally not on. I repeat, not on. I was so confused why I was winning. I was like, how am I doing this? I turn it on again, you idiot. She's like, oh, my God. You have a handicap on. That's the only reason you're winning. Jade, if you touch the glow, you die. Literally. Cheats. You don't die. Do not listen. I was going down somehow. Like, take my hand.

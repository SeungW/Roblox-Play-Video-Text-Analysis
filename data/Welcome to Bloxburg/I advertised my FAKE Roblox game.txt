Guys. The game that I helped make survive Albert, it had a good run, but you know, it's a it's tied down a little bit, so I gotta start improvising. I got I just ate a lot of chocolate and I felt the chocolate just landed my throat. Alright, we're good. I gotta expand. I gotta expand my business mind, man. I gotta make more Roblox. And how will I do that? A brand new game, which I am starting today. Let me see what's doing good on Roblox. Top earning not bad. I mean, Blocksburg is like right next to adopt me, pretty much, but with like way less people. And Blocksburg costs money. I can make a free game. I could do that. And people will buy things at it. See, and how many more people will be playing us if it was free? So I'm going to ask copus to make it free. No, I'm going to make my own Blocksburg. I'm going to do it. I don't care. I'm really old. Blocksburg official. No, my identity official. 

Dev Blocksburg Developer Team. There we go. This is so scummy. All right, time to remake Blocksburg once and for all. I'm going into hacker mode, so I'm going to make my own Blocksburg and then I'm going to advertise it a lot, so a lot of people play it and then I get more players in Blocksburg. It's as easy as that. Blocksburg free version. Yes, sisters. Let's see if there's actually like a copy of Blocksburg I can steal. There's this thing where's the rest of the map though? Is that Blocksburg? I can't really tell. That's definitely not Blocksburg. Well, if people haven't actually played it, they might not know the difference. Okay, this is actual hot, disgusting trash. I think people will notice the difference. Is that bacon hair for the trees? No, uturn. That's literally showing a left turn. Okay, whatever. They don't need to know road signs. All right. There's only certain things that are stolen successfully from Blocksburg. 

I don't think this is one of them, but I'm going to act like it is. All right, so I just got to make a bunch of these. All right, we're off to a really good start. This looks exactly like Block. Is that Blocksburg? No, it's Blocksburg free version. Completely different game. So it's a neighborhood and the son of their solar system is the Burger Planet or Pizza Planet. So everybody at midnight every single night gathers around to worship Pizza Planet. I'm not sure if what I'm doing is allowed. I know what I'm doing is not the right thing to do, but I'm not sure if it's not allowed. You know what I mean? So it's something I shouldn't be doing, but am I allowed to do it? Probably dead guy. You know the dead guy that's in Blokesburg. This guy. All right, where should this guy go? Let's just put him right here. So it's like it's almost noticeable. You know what I mean? All right, put that guy right there. If anything, this is just slightly better version than Blocksburg. 

All right. Somebody's chopped off Bleeding Head. That can work. Oh, by the way, before I get too off track and forget to say this, if you're watching this, as soon as this video comes out, you pretty much have, like, one day to get a flamingo merch. Pretty much all of you seem to like the or the either the pink one or the orange one right here. Yeah, you have, like, one and a half days, I think, to get that, so act fast. No, you actually probably just have, like, one more day left and then I think all this will just be gone forever, if anything. Like yeah, it's pretty much just going to be there's a last chance to get it. All right, so to get that adopt and raise a cute baby crowd in here, I'm going to have an adoption center. It's like a two storey. You got your pizza downstairs. No, that's not going to work. That's a bad concept. Like, as soon as you're done, like, eating a very unhealthy pizza, you go upstairs and you'll take some kids. You can adopt this dead police officer. You can adopt him. Bob, can we please get that one? 

That one's so cute. All right, so you can either turn into the disgusting monster creature, the pill, or the small man. All right, so I got the game. Pretty much an exact replica of Blocksburg. And like I said, if nobody's played it, if they haven't played it, how are they going to judge me? How are they going to tell me what's Blocksburg? This is just a new update. I need the icon, but I'm not a thief, so I'm not going to steal, because I did that with Life in paradise, and maybe that wasn't the best thing to do. So I'm just going to have to draw it. All right, so we're going to start off with his hair. I'm going to draw it so his hair kind of spikes up like that and then maybe goes down and like that. And then we just fill that in right there. Then he has just completely black eyes because he is devoid of any soul and will eat you at a moment's notice. God, this is so bad. All right, there's his teeth. He also has skin, believe it or not, and he stole that skin from another human. 
 
I'm not really good at coloring inside the line, so I'll just do that. That's good enough. They've never even played Blocksberg. How are they going to tell me what's right and what's wrong in this universe? All right, so then he has these really long fingers. One of them kind of curls over like that. And then one kind of has there we go. So he's waving to you. He's really overweight and he doesn't wear a shirt. And everybody knows that on his right arm, he's actually losing one of his fingers and it's dripping blood. I should probably give him a shirt, though. All right, so it's starting to come together. This is Believable, and he also has blue pants, and he just got really thick legs, so it's just how he looks. If you guys are judging him, I'm going to ban you. All right, there's his eyes that everyone knows him for. And then we could just draw in the background real quick. All right, so if they don't believe this, then they have that right there to go off of. 
 
You know what I mean? So I'll just leave it at this. This will be the game icon if Roblox accepts it. All right. Hopefully I would click that. I would click that and say, wow, I can't believe Blocksburg is doing an update where they're where they made of the game Free. All right, I'll put 15,000 Robucks on Blocksburg free. Oh, yeah. Our icon got accepted, so it's right there. We're going to just go see how many people we can get the Blocksburg free before we get banned. And I'll put 5000 Robucks on the phone users. All right. I'm going to just go ghost and let people do their thing. So if you look here, we got a blood stain, and then we got we have that in the toilet. We got a guy. Hey, man. Ed Blocksburg. Look, you just gave birth to a child. Look, that's your baby. And your baby just archaeological and just actually died as well. He sucks baby love, boy. 

Whoa. Look at that cute baby. That's adorable. Get in the stroller. Okay. It keeps killing people when they go in the stroller. This guy thinks he just has a oh, God. Wait. Oh, God. Oh, no. He just went in the bathroom. Yes. Blocksburg. Wow. Blocksburg looks so cool. See, guys, some people just that person is making fun of me. Look at this gold. See, he couldn't afford to play Blocksburg because he spent all his money on this gold. And then that gold diamond chain right there. I look so pretty. A lot of people are joining. I feel bad. Whoa. Blocksburg. I just want a new server to start because this is annoying. Everyone's attacking people with the strollers. I don't know why they expect this to happen. Look, they're creating, like, a chain of them. This is epic. All right. Oh, my God. Okay, a new server started. I'm going to go to that one. The other server filled up very quickly. 

Blocksburg. Hi. Blocksburg is so cool. This is fake. Die, then blocky blocked. Report. No, please don't. Report. Please stop. Nice game, XD. Don't ever say it to me again. That's not a big fund. And original Blocksberg is not crap. It's a big fund. I put 20,000 robots into this game. This game costs 20,000 robots to make. How do I kill people? All right, I gave him a sword. Hey. Only do it if they do things wrong. Keep them in check for me. Game reported. Hey. Stop. Kill him. There is no escape. Why I stop? I will report and report. This is free Boxberg. Free Boxberg. Free Boxberg. Report to this. If you can kill him, kill him. This is the real Boxburg. Oh, my God. Updates. Yes. 

Queen. We love a supportive queen. Hey, take back report. Take it back. Please. Undo it. Nobody love me. Undo it, man. I will report this game. Please, dude, stop. My legs. Remove my life. Please. I'm actually a game developer. I'm better. I'm better than you. I could help you. I could help you. This game is so good. See? Satisfied customer right there. Look how thin and close to death I look. I love this. I ate a child. I will eat another, okay? A police died. No, stop saying that. I am not kidding. I am not young. All right? Stop. Stop. Don't say that. Liar. Nothing but a liar. Okay, look, if I am liar or not what? I just put it below with beetles. See? No, there's nothing there. Babies go here. April 8. Odd. No cry. 

See? Baby go here. My kneecaps. Goo goo. Stupid. You know, Roblox ads work pretty good. This has, like, almost 60 people playing at 06:00. A.m. Fake. How many times do I have to tell these people? This is not a fake game. This is real. I made this. Blocksbug. Oi, yes. Blocksbug. Fake. You is my friend. Yes. Best friend. And I will prove that with a friend request. Wow. Look at Shake. Hi, ads. Nice character, dude. Enjoy blocksbug. You know, go. Commit. Enjoy blocksbug. No, don't look in the toilet. Don't go in the toilet. Don't go in there. Thank you, guys. It's fake. No, don't. Stop it. You're ruining my life. How'd you get in there? You're ruining me. Fake. Just maybe go. Innocent person. Stop. Why won't you die? You all upgrade game. Yes. Yes. Upgrade game. Oh, I forgot about that guy back there. 

He's there not stop saying that. Fairy poop games. No, I'm the Blocksburg dev team. Not very poop games, sir. I'm a very satisfied see, we got some people who probably caught on. That's me and that's okay. That game is so real. Wow. You meet. Thank you. Yeah, I'm just going to oh, my God. This game is so many people. I'm going to take this game down now because 72 people I wish I could just leave these up, but because I use free models like these things, it could have a virus. But I'm here to if a hacker were to get on that owns these models, they could do anything they want to my game. Don't want that to happen. Want to keep my Blocksburg safe. Vera Blocksburg is unsafe. Mine big safe. Let me know what other games I should redo, what other games I should upgrade. And spruce up. My God. I forgot that. Forgot that. That was the thumbnail for it. Oh, yeah. Also, merch, if you didn't get it, they'll you got one day. 

Yeah.

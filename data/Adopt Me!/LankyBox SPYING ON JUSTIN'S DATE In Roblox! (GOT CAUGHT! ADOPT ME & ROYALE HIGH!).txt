Whoa. It's actually a girl. You literally can't really even see me. I can see them perfectly. Justin's actually out of date, and there are a couple. I'm high in the sky. They won't be able to find me. I'm not Princess Zona. No. What is up, guys? Welcome to this episode. I'll like you books. Yeah. Today I am spying on Justin's date and Roblox. Okay, guys, so I got got to be kind of quiet because I think Justin is on a date. I woke up this morning, I was like, hey, Justin, you ready to film some Adam videos? And he said, actually, I can't today, Adam. I got an important date. And I was like, yeah, right. So I think he's lying. I don't think he's actually on a date, but we're going to see if he's actually telling the truth or not. I'm going to go in my spy mode and see. Wait. Justin's typing in the chat. He says, which one would you like? And then Princess Donut says, the massive gift. Wait. Who's? Princess Donut. I don't think I've ever met this account before. It's actually telling the truth. So they're clearly at the gift stand. Okay, I got to go. I got to go real sneaky. I don't want him to know that I'm spying on him. I'm going to be super sneaky. 
I'm not going to type in chat. I'm actually going to turn to a baby because then I'm smaller, and then I can, like, spy even easier. He says, if you get a ChuChu train, can I have it? Sure. Oh, so they're hatching gifts together. Oh, yeah, I see them. Guys, guys, I'm going to go over here and hide. I'm going to go over here and hide. Is that actually Justin with a girl? I can hide right here by the stand. They say, I got a boomerang. He says, what did you get? Oh, they're hatching gifts together. That's actually so cute. I got to get a closer look at what this girl looks like. Princess Donut. I can't really see what her face looks like. I'm going to try and go over here without Justin noticing. I'm going to make a run for it. He says, ha. It's a boomerang. That's perfect for Adam. And Justin says he's a boomer. I'm not a boomer. Guys. Boxy. Am I a boomer? No. Yeah. See? Foxy tells the truth, and Rocky agrees too. I'm going to make my way behind the pet shop, and then I think I can actually see what she looks like. Let's see. Okay, perfect. If you zoom out, you literally can't really even see me. But I can see them perfectly. Okay, let me get a look. Oh. Whoa. 
It's actually a girl. Whoa. Okay, Justin. Okay. I did not think it was going to be real. I thought it was going to be like, a broom with, like, a wig on it or something. Okay. Justin's saying it's really hard to see with these massive gifts. You look great, princess. Donut. Check out my cool dance. See, I'm strong. I go to the gym. So Justin's flexing a bit. He's trying to impress Princess Donut. And she says, wow, this is so fun. I mean, this date seems to be going pretty well. I think Justin might have seen me. Did he? No, I think he was grappling. He says misclick. He did not see me. He did not see me. I just misclick my grapple. Okay, I'm still here. He cannot see me. I don't know if I should do, like, a little prank on Justin and I don't know, crash the date. I'm trying to think of ideas that I can use to make his date go a little less than peachy. He says, let's go get some pets for you to put in that new stroller. And she says, okay, thank you. I could maybe try calling him like, a scammer. Like, I could walk up to him and be like, hey, Justin, are you scamming this girl? And then maybe she'll be like, confused. 
Oh, she's alone. She's alone. Who's this boomer over here? Oh, hello. I am a stranger. Oh, no. Justin says wait, what? Oh, no, he told me. He told me he saw me. Well, I'm going to go in the hatchery. I'm going to go on the hatchery. Princess Donut says I don't know. I think it was an NPC. Yeah, good. She doesn't know. Looked super weird. Okay, so they did not know it was me. They think I'm like a non playable character in the game. Yeah, it was Oops Doug. I mean, he says or street waffington wait, what suggested oh, no, I shouldn't have typed. I said at the start of the video I wasn't going to type anything. I can read chat. I'm just going to stop typing. He's saying I'm getting in a new server. Weirdo. Should I ask him? Are you on a date? Oh, I can't type date. It got tang. Are you on a date? Does that work? Yes, it does. No. They laugh before I could say it. I got to track Justin. Let me see what it is counts up to. Oh, okay. I went on his profile. It says, Join James. Will this teleport me to where he is? Oh, he's in Royal High. Oh, it says attempted to teleport to a place that is restricted. 
Justin, where are you? I'm going to go to explore the world. Where would Justin be? I'm going to guess he went to the classic campus, royal High. This is a great place for a date. They got a bunch of really cool places to go. I bet he's in the cafeteria. I'm going to go over here. I'm going to fly over here. Not even go fly. Okay, he's not here. I'm going to try teleporting. Let's see where else I can go in royal High. Okay, I'm going to try going back to the classic campus. Guys, guys, I got to run. I got a runner. I got to run. Okay, hopefully it doesn't see me, but I think that's Justin with Princess Donut. Six one four. That's her. He's saying, hey, this is fun. This game is cool. Let me get my suit. Hentai I have a gold suit just like this in real life. Let me finish getting customized. Wow. Okay. Justin's trying to flex. I know. In Royal High. There's a cell phone. Should I try texting justin tips on what to do on the date. Hi, Justin. I'm going to see if he gets my text. Normally he doesn't reply to my text in real life, but I'm going to see if he replies to me in Royale. Hi, I'm putting my phone away for now. 
Okay. Princess owner says, wow, we are a nice looking couple. They're a couple. Wow. And then Justin says, AF nine f J. He says, Sorry, I lag definitely didn't panic. I'm definitely not nervous. Then Princess Donut says, ha ha. XD. And then Justin says he and then Princess Donut says he and then Justin says he. Justin's actually on his date with a girl, and there a couple. This is insane. Oh, no. She sees me. Stay till I'm not going to type. I'm not going to type. I learned my lesson last time. I must say something that an NPC would say. Non playable character. Welcome to Royale. Hi, my name is Bob. Please, please tell me this works. This NPC bob is nice. Okay. She bought it. She says he looks worse than Sir Wilkinson, and that guy is tough. Hey, excuse me. Don't you mean I am super cool? Let's see, let's see, let's see. No franchise. Donut. What the heck? Justin says, I'm finishing customizing. I'll be there in a set. 
Okay, they're leaving. I got to follow them. I got to follow them. I'm going to fly high in the sky because what's the last place people look up, so if I'm high in the sky, they won't be able to find me. I'm not princess. Donut. No. How is the NPC flying? I can teach you how to fly in Royale High. I'm going to just sound super robotic. Would you like to learn? For $50, hopefully she just says, no, I don't want to spend any money, and leaves. Justin says, I'm at the top of the wheel. Princess Donna says I can use Justin Robucks. He has a ton of Robucks. He gets his Robucks from Adam. Oh. She laughed before I could tell her the truth. Followed up. I think this girl's on to me. If this were among us, she would say I'm sus. But I don't think she can prove that I'm not an MPC. Okay. Okay, guys, I think I see Justin over there. I don't see princess. Donut. Oh, there she is. I'm a hide. Right here, right here, right here. I'm going to make my getaway. I don't think he can see me, especially if I'm right here. Okay. Justin says, very peaceful here without Adam. What? I bring peace to people, he says. 
I'll go get us a snack. Guys, this is my chance to talk to Princess Donut. I'm going to tell her what Justin really is. Princess Donut, I need to tell you something. Justin steals all my Robucks. He actually isn't rich. He steals them from me and then makes me drink milk from a bottle. I'm going to try and sabotage the date. Why is this dog looking NBC following me? Justice. Hopefully justin didn't see me. He's typing. Did he see me? Please say no. He says I was buying you a donut. I didn't see oh, no. I fell. Okay. I could just fly up. I could just fly up. Oh, this is perfect. He says it's so weird. He asked me for a milk bottle. No, I didn't ask you for a milk bottle. I was trying to expose Justin that he always makes me drink from this bottle for some reason. Just to embarrass me. Is the game lagging? If I just sit behind them, then they won't be able to see me. He kept talking about wanting milk. He really wanted milk. No, Princess, donut. 
You misunderstood what I was saying. Oh, no. I think that's easy. I am Bob. I am here to help you learn Royale High. I'm just going to act like a computer, except for I Misspelled Royal High. Oh, no. He says this guy can't spell. Meanwhile, he's saying you am idiots. I think you should speak for yourself. This guy is a creepy stalker. No, I'm not a stalker. I was just trying to sabotage your date. Oh, no. They left, okay? They revived me. He says he kept asking me for milk. Doesn't just adam. Go away, Bruh. I was just trying to expose you. Why were you lying? Where does he go? Where does everything he's what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was trying to sabotage your real date. Why? Because I heard you saying stuff about how you have all these Robucks. 
I do? I just wanted to make sure you weren't accidentally dating a gold digger. You were trying to help me out. Yeah, you're trying to help me out with that. I'm your best friend. I don't want you to get reigned of all your money. It's funny. We're at the drama theater because there's some drama going on. You want to find your fault? Sure. You just lost TKO. I was trying to help you. You were not. Yes, I was trying to let Princess Donna know that you actually don't have a lot of robots. Such a bad spy. We saw you would adopt me. I even left the gate. That was because I was a baby. And you're a baby in real life. No, you're a baby. And then you say you're you kept asking my date for a milk bottle. She got so weird. No, she left. I was in a discord. Call her. She left. She said, you're welcome. I just saved you from digging a gold digger. No, you did it. You'll ruin my one chance at finding love.

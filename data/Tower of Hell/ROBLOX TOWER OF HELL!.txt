Excuse me, sir. Put some clothes on. Look how much I'm concentrating. Wow, that's a new look. I'm back and I'm playing some roblox. You guys have been spamming me to play roblox again while I'm here on Tower of Hell. Can you be the first to talk in this randomly generated orbit with absolutely no no checkpoints at all? Well, you're in luck, because I am the obi queen. I have done so many roadblocks obese, I feel like I have been training for this since the day I was born. Maybe that's an exaggeration. I haven't played an Obi in a long time. Oh, my gosh. Look how many friend requests I have. That's insane. Can we get it to a million guys? That would make my day. Show me the tower. What is going on? We're inside an obi, right? We need to get up here. I believe I know the way. We have to go. What is happening? Oh, my goodness. These things move. 
You can't really stay on them for very long then. Otherwise it's going to fall over, isn't it? I'm blue. Ordinary fiesta. What is going on? This is so easy. I said that I fell. I was going to say this is so easy so far and I literally fell off the map since you are blocking me. She's going to get me killed. I swear. There are so many people at this particular part. I am terrified. Oh, my goodness. I fell right to the bottom. I really just did that. I'm embarrassed. In my sales on the side here. It shows everyone's progress. I want to beat everyone else. I want to be the very best like no one ever was. I'm so far at the bottom you can't even see where I am. I just wish I was still as good as I was two years ago at Obi's. Hello. Hi. I'm doing terrible. Any tips? 
Tell me, happy dancing men. How do I complete the Tower of Hell? Just practice. That's very useful to me. Thank you for your help. Is this like a timer? Is it going down? What happens when it gets to zero? I'm very concerned. I don't know what is happening. I'm so scared. They said just practice, so I am so sorry to everyone watching this right now because watching me struggle is so embarrassing. I'm just so embarrassed of how bad I am. Oh, my goodness. Oh. Double jump. We can buy things to help us. We're going to buy double jump. Come on, Yummy. You used to be great at this. This is actually painful to play because I'm just so bad. Maybe double jump is a curse. Sometimes it's double jumping when I don't mean to. That's very concerning. This is just so tall. I don't know if I'm ever going to complete this. Oh, no. The timer and I fell. 
It's going to happen. It's going to reach zero. Are we all going to explode? I'm scared. I'm scared. Oh, wait. It's like a new level. Oh, great. Maybe I'm bare at this one. I love how excited everybody is for a fresh new car. Maybe we can do it left or right? We have a decision to make. I'm going to go left because nobody else has. Why am I already so bad at this? I've literally just started this level and I can't do it. What the heck? Maybe it's the right way. What the heck is this? All right, let's go. Maybe if I just keep jumping, I can get across it, because I don't know why this works, but it just does. I understand why it's called Tower of Hell now. Oh, my goodness. Maybe I can now. I'm sorry about SIS. What is wrong with your head? The legs do not fit the body. I do not know what that was. An alien, maybe? Maybe it was an alien. How embarrassing. Everybody else is doing so much better than me. Give me a break, though. 
I can't remember the last time I played Roblox. Very stressful. No? Breathe. Yammy. We can do this. Wait, are you telling me when you buy an item in this that you don't get to keep it? I'll waste up my robots. Concentrate. Concentrate. Yummy. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. I've never made it this far before. Wow, the talent. Look at her go. I have to make it to this. I did it. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. I am so much further than I've ever been before. Oh, my goodness. I nearly fell. I nearly fell. Oh, wow. Yes. Wow. Okay, this is definitely where I fall. No. Why? That was the first I've ever gotten before and I fell. Oh, we have a minute to do it. Oh, yeah. I'm not doing that. Yeah, there's no way. Excuse me, sir. Put some clothes on. 
I feel like this is one of those games that I'm just never going to be able to complete. And we just have to accept the fact that I'm so bad. Can I cheat and get to the end? Is that, like, a good thing I can do? New level, new me. Cheat is stood on air. How is this happening? Oh, my gosh. These spinning platforms are insane. How am I going to get up all of these? Oh, wow. She only went and did it. Okay, green triangles. This looks pretty simple. What is that? Is that like a death triangle? I feel like that's going to kill me. Let's see if these girls can do it first. Oh, she got hit. That person made it past. All right, I need to do it. I need to go sooner than later because the time is running out. All right, let's go now. Let's go now. Oh, no. I look like a pretty ballerina. 
Please don't kill me. Triangle of death. Oh, my wow. My head went flying. It's okay. I can do it this time. No, I can't I've already started it off. But this is surely impossible, right? Oh, no. My goal is to just get past this triangle, and if I do, then I'm going to be so happy. Let's go. What? I, for some reason, suck at this. Let's go, everyone. Let's see how far we can get. What the heck is going on? I feel like this is the perfect opportunity for me to go. Oh, my gosh. I am navigating these scary poles. If I touch one, I will die. Yes. I made it through. I'm confused. I don't know where I have to go. This is so stressful. There is so much going on right now. There's people dying everywhere. 
I can't even complete one level of this. You have to trust the process and come over your head, even though it's terrifying. Oh, my gosh. I did it. I actually did it. How do I get up there? Maybe if I jump around the side, I'm going to concentrate and maybe I can complete this. And now I have to swap sides. I managed it. Oh, yes. Sammy, look at us go. Loop jump. What is that? What's a loop jump? Oh, I see. What are you doing? Hello. Are you cheating? Is this allowed? How can I do that? Oh, no. I got so close. Look at a squad moving out. Squad, roll out. Let's go. Who can get up there first? Not me. Look how much I'm concentrating. If I concentrate enough, maybe I can do it. 
I made it to the corner catch zone. There is a floating platform of doom. This looks incredibly difficult to do. I'm going to have to gamble it, aren't I? No one, like, equals one prayer at the Yami. They should rename this to the world's most annoying tower. Or maybe the world's worst tower because that's how I'm feeling about it right now. I need to watch how somebody does this. I do not understand. Wow. I need to do that. I need to jump on it. Run. Jump off it. No. I was so close. There's 50 seconds left on this. Oh, no. What this person? What the heck? What was that? There is a lot going on right now. When should I jump? Is there ever a right time to jump? Because this looks terrifying all of the time. 
Oh, my gosh. My toes are, like, literally on this. AHA, I'm so close to death. But I have managed it somehow. Wasn't go me. Then let's swap over to this side. Yes. Yummy. This is what we love to see. When I can actually do the parkour, the white ones need to stay away. If I jump and hit one with my head, it's game over. Oh, no. I fell all the way back down to this platform thingy. No, I think, honestly, taking your time with this is probably the best method. How do I get over there? Oh, you just jump. I was so close. I nearly died. Oh, my gosh. I'm going to be so sad if I somehow mess this up. How do I do this? 
Don't tell me I have to jump around the side of it. Don't. No. I'm so scared of it. How did you do that? No. Ladies are so difficult for me. There is a skill in everything and unfortunately, I do not possess this skill. Oh, my gosh, I'm so bad. I'm going to concentrate and not talk and see if I can actually do it. Skip the dan course. We want to get onto the next one. Here we are. You have to get it on the right angle so you like, lift yourself up. But I can't. I just can't double jump. I'm a habit. The only way I can complete this is with the double jump, apparently. Oh, my gosh. I made it. I actually made it. Wow. What is this? No. 
Moving platforms are the worst. No, I shouldn't be allowed to play on this ever again. This platform? This one. Oh, my goodness. We've made it to the green. Can I make that? I'm going to try it anyway. Oh, no. I wish there was checkpoints. I really do. I wish there was checkpoints. Oh, I've made it back to this point. Oh, my gosh. I'm actually making some progress here. What the heck? No, I say that and I think to myself, why do I say that? If I say it, then I die instantly. I should know better. You really have to use your brain with this one because it changes the side. Now I have to swap side. See? Wow, that's a new look. I'm actually the furthest. I feel like there's a lot of responsibility hanging on my shoulders right now and if I fall, I'm going to be so sad. I'm so close to completing it. 
Oh, no. I didn't know that was a thing. I didn't know that was a thing that could happen. Making my way downtown I fell off. I want to cry now. Oh, no, it's this part again. I don't understand it. I don't get it. No, I don't know what is happening. Where we're going? Someone's recognized me. Hello. Nice to meet you. I wish I wasn't so embarrassingly bad at this game. So close. Yes. What do we do now? What the heck? Oh, no, not the floating platforms again. Oh, my goodness. This is so scary. What is happening? No, guys, how are you meant to do this? I'm so terrible at it. It's not even a joke. This is my first time m and at least I tried. Guys, I'm going to leave the video there. 
I hope you did enjoy it. If you did do, make sure to leave a like. And if you want to watch another video of mine, you can click here and let's go watch it together.

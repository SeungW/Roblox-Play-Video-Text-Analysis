Today we're gonna spend a bit of robots to get the best restaurant and restaurant tycoon too. Restaurant money. I have my own restaurants. No, you don't. You're too broke. You don't know how to cook. I have a German restaurant. I sell bratwosh. What is bratwos? Deutsche hot dog. Okay, okay. I got an American restaurant. America. We only get style burgers and fries. Look at this. I already got two customers. Table for two. How do I address them? I'm not a waiter, okay? I can click the customer. Click a table for these customers. Boom. Oh, my. This guy got a whole golden chain. It's such a romantic restaurant. And then they're like, I'll take a cheeseburger. I got you. I'll give you cheeseburger. Yes. British food so you can kidney pie, fish and chips. Oh, you're disgusting. You're not going to get any customers. What do you mean? I've already got cheese socks. I made two cheeseburgers. Two cheeseburgers. I cut up tomatoes, and I'm serving them. 
Boom. You're eating the burgers with a fork and a knife. Fake American. I'm this close to kicking them out. Okay, so we can well, okay. We can build things. We can workers, hire new chefs. How much money do it? Oh, I have enough. Hire chef. Hello, chef. Cutting tomato. Why am I doing all the work, Mr. Chef? You do it. Why is my name Censored of my restaurant? It's victory. This blazer brought food. 69 Wait, you can taste the name of your restaurant? All right, that's a pretty good name. Duck chef. You let the burgers on fire. Jane, we're your youth plan. I got a burnt burger here. Please don't like it. I beg of you. Oh, my God. I just made $20.04, people. It's going to go pretty slow, I think. See? Little do you know the power of Bob. I'm just going to get a little cash income from my dead relative. Just a little bit. Let's just start with, I don't know, maybe $500. Not too much. All right, we got $500. You know what? I think it's time for a I need a waiter. 
Yes. Oh, my chef is finally working. He's chopping zebras woods. My chef is not doing anything. He's just looking and staring. Food is burning. Why do I have a chef? Then why are you he just wants to get burning. There's no way this is real. Oh, you can buy more tables and chairs. Interesting. Oh, wow. You can even get, like, tip jars and stuff. Tip jars? Waiter trays allowed to carry multiple plates. Okay, I'll buy that. Now they can tip us more money for our famous burnt burger. Hey. Day one complete. Nice. Oh, I got a new dish. Yes. Water. I want onion ring. Oh, finally, I can hire a waiter. I don't have to do anything. That sounds like you're just lazy. No, it's called strategy. Oh, no, you can add anything you want to your restaurant. All right, toilet seat right outside the door. What? If you want to take a dump outside, now you can. Oh, this is beautiful. This is beautiful. Talk about an entrance. 
Wait, is my chef actually cooking now? I think he is. He's actually doing things now. Before he just watched the burgers just burn. Oh, wait. Maybe you should come to my restaurant. Juicy. I'm on my way. All right. Oh, wait, no more money. I can fix that. You know what? What about $2,500? Just a little bit of money. Oh, you're over here. Oh, yeah, I changed the location. I moved right next to the residential area. You moved right next to me? Oh, yeah. I'm going to take you out of business. What? You have a toilet? No. British people. What is this? Socks. What is this? Well, you're not allowed in. Do I need to call security? Where's your security? Where's your security? You got your security? Me, actually, I would like one cheeseburger, please. But you actually ordered something. I actually ordered burger. Can I sit somewhere? Where's my sheep? I'll get a seat just for you, Mr. Blaza. Anything for you, Mr. Blaza. I got you. Is that enough tables for Youza? Let's have a date. Is that my cheeseburger? Oh, delicious. But you actually got a burger. 
What is this? What? It says low quality trash gosh. Not my burger. I don't want that. We put our heart and soul into that. Zero stars. I don't even want to hear it. Wow, day two ranked poor. I thought I did well. Do I need more workers? All right, I got a new waiter, a new and a new chef. Where's my second waiter? Why is the waiter sitting down in one of the chairs? Or you could fire them. I'm this close. I might. And I can even expand plot. Oh, whoa. Bigger restaurant. We got holes in a restaurant now. What are you doing here? What are you talking about? I want to see what these wiener snitches are all about. You need to leave. Hey, my snitchel. No, put that down. You know what? I'm going to take this back to my restaurant and we'll learn the recipe. No, we'll learn the recipe you got back here. It's a family recipe. I need more people. I got all this extra room and empty walls. I need more money. 
Store. Oh, wait, I can't get auto collection. Yes, I would love auto collection. You know, let's get an earning boost as well. Mega tables. I'll take a mega table. All right, what's this mega table about? What the it doesn't even fit inside the restaurant, all right? I'm kicking out all my customers, and it's for a good cause. Okay, you know what the problem with your guys? Restaurants in. You don't have enough fresh air. That's the problem. All right? All these walls. All right? This is what a real restaurant looks like. But where is your house? What is going on here? You just have toilets. What's the point? It's a marketing strategy. Now we can put in our mega tables. Okay. We'll make it even better. We got to stand out from the competition. We got to stand out. Big tables, knees, big chairs, egg seats. Oh, my God. Look at all these seats. 20 people in one table. Uhoh, day four poor. You see my restaurant? Who wants to come to my restaurant? 
What is this? This is so man. Look at all shit. To get the safe table. Well, we better start cooking. There's only one chef that is available. I got to step in. I got to step in. Oh, God. I didn't think this through. There's more people coming in. Not more. Why did I put so many tables? Oh, my God. Yes. Am I waiter? He's got three things on a plate. Look at that efficiency. And not a single British person. All right, I think we need to hire more people. Let's get another chef. Let's get another chef, and let's get two more waiters. I need to expand my plot. Let's build it. We can get a drive through. A delivery. A second floor. Okay, where are you going to stack it? On air? Yes. The first floating air restaurant. They left 20 people. $200. That's it. I think it's time to close my restaurant for a little bit. It is time to do some revamping. Let's buy some money. 
All right, we got $30,000. 2nd floor. Yes. And you know what? Let's buy the drive through as well. We got a road. Okay. And you know what? Megaplat as well. Oh, wait. I just spent all my money on the drive through. Wait, I did a bicep board, buddy. All right, we got 30 grand. That should that should give us a little bit of lean way. Let us store all of this. We are changing things up now. This is what a real restaurant looks like. It's just land. Let's see how the second floor works. Oh, my God. You're going to walk into royalty when you're at my this is like the King's palace. There we go. Oh, my God. I made a whole plane. What is going on here? Why did you make a pirate plank? It was part of the restaurant design. Imagine you walk into a restaurant, and then it's toilet. Five star restaurant, by the way. This is five star. No way. This five stars. It's not even two stars. Wait, can I put another staircase? Can I just go infinitely high? Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God. Look at this. This is the future of restauranting. Okay, I can't go any higher, though, which is weird. That explains why it's just second floor, but I could still have the staircases go like that. When you enter my restaurant, you actually have to break your leg. Is your restaurant even open? No, I'm making money. How do you afford all of these? I killed my family members. All right, I think we're ready now. How are they supposed to get onto the second floor? No, you have to walk up the stairs, break your legs and then you can walk in. It is going to work? That's what we're going to find out. Right. Open a deer restaurant. We are opening the restaurant. Oh, the people coming in. Oh, my God. They're going up the stairs. Oh, my God. Does it work? They just walk through the stairs. They're not even using the system how it's designed to. I wonder why, but they're finding their way in. This is so great. It's working. Enough staff for this. I'll get enough staff. I'll get more waiter. Another waiter. 
Another waiter. Another waiter. I think that's enough waiter. There are a couple of people lost at the first floor. They're just admiring the toilet paper staff. They better be tipping us. I think we have enough tips to see you have zero cash in every single one. Why is your weighter floating around? Oh, that's normal. I'm running out of money. I need to buy some more money here. Does that mean you're not making any money? I'm not making any money. What's the use of the toilet road? It's for the view. It's the main attraction. We made money. Yeah, we're making some money. I made $100. We're at three and a half stars. Can you believe it? Design is for it. Seven. How's that nearly five stars of design.

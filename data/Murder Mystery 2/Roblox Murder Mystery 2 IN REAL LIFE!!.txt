Since I have no friends in Quarantine, I decided to edit together Roblox. Mm. Two in real life only. Oh, sheriff. Oh, my gosh. I got sheriff in real life too. Man, that's freaking awesome. I'm gonna love this. Alright, guys, so I guess what we got to do since we're sheriff is, is try to find the murderer. I mean, I don't know who it's going to be. I've got a few roommates, so I guess we got to see who got the murderer this round. Let's go, guys. Actually, really quickly, guys, before we go out there, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hide this so that nobody knows that I'm the sheriff. We can pretend like we're innocent, so put it away. And here we go, guys. Hey. Oh, hey. What's up, man? How's it going? You playing? Mm, two. Also. You're innocent as well. Oh, me too. Okay, so I guess we got to find the murderer then. Yo, what's up, man? Are you innocent down there? The murderer is right in your room. Oh, thank God. There's literally nobody in there, so that would have been scary. 
All right, so I guess we got to find this innocent. I mean, this murderer. All right. What's over here? Oh, what the heck? What the this is a messy map. Jeez, man, I would hate to live here. It's so messy. Okay, over here. Murderer. Oh, gosh. What is this? Oh, my goodness. Oh, God. Is that gophy. Oh, God. I think we'll be okay. Okay, that's pretty scary. All right, so if Ant is not the murderer, then let's check Joe. Joe might be the murderer. Okay. Joe. Is he over here? Joe. Joe. Who's joe. Joe. Joe. Joe. Joe. That's not Joe. I guess we should check Joe's room. All right. Joe. Dude, I'm scared. I'm kind of scared, dude. I don't know if he's probably got to be the murderer if it's not any of us. Joe. Joe. Joe, are you in there? Joe. Joe. 
Let's go. Let's go on. He's probably hiding, Bo. He's probably going to try to attack us. We got to be careful. Joe. What? He's not in here. What? Joe. Okay, well, this is weird, bro. Let me tell you something. What's up, bro? You're innocent? Yeah. Ants innocent. I'm innocent. Well, here's the thing. I'm not actually innocent, bro. Wait. I'm actually the sheriff, but I don't know where the murderer is, so I don't know what to do. What am I supposed to do? So you're the sheriff the whole time? Yeah, and Joe's literally not in here. So that means what? Oh, my gosh. I got them, guys. I got them. Yo, like it? Subscribe and turn on all notifications. Why are there so many buttons? Whoa. Oh my gosh. I got murderer, guys. Oh, my goodness. Oh. So here's my weapon. Well, there's an interesting looking weapon, but anyways, guys, I'm going to keep it in my pocket so that we can be nice and sneaky here and let's see who else is in this round, guys. All right, here we go. Oh, yo, Zach. 
What's up, bro? You're playing? Mm, two again, bro. How's it going, man? How's it going? You are innocent. I'm innocent. You sure you're innocent, bro? Last time you kind of tricked me there, bro. I don't know, you're acting really fast. You're acting real suspicious is all I'm saying, bro. Well, I mean, we can start wait, what is that? You scared me. Rod. Thought that was a knife, Rover. All right, well, I guess we got to figure out who the murderer is. Wait, so do you have a gun by chance? No, I'm not that, bro. Okay, we can get through the house. All right. Yeah. Let's check Joe again. Remember last time, he wasn't even there. I wonder if he's in this round. All right, we're going to go this way over to Joe's room. What was that? This is my new email, bro. Oh, drink email, bro. Pretty cool. All right, well, guess it's time to go ahead and check Joe and see if he's the murderer, bro. I'm a little bit nervous. All right, here we go. Joe. Joe, break in. 
We got a break in, bro. Bro, how's it going? Yo, how's it going? I'm innocent, bro. I've been innocent since the beginning. Really? I've never been anything so you're innocent? What are you guys and you're innocent? I'm innocent. So neither of you guys are the sheriff? Maybe? Well, one of us is lying. Wait. Yeah, I'm innocent. You're telling me that you don't have a gun? No, I'm asking you guys. All I'm saying is I'm innocent. I don't have a gun. Wait, what did you say? I said, are either of you guys sheriff? No. Why would you be asking that if you're innocent? What do you mean? Sounds like a very murderous thing to ask. I mean, are you guys a murderer? No. I mean, I guess. Well, guys, if you guys are both innocent, then I'm sorry. Come back here, bro. Come back. Revenge. Revenge. Come here, bro. I got to win the round. I got to win the round. 
Whoa, no, don't shoot. Wait, wait, don't shoot, don't shoot. Are you about to buy some Robucks? Well, make sure you support me by adding my star code by clicking here and typing Se E and adding it. Thank you so much for your support. Okay, let's see what we're going to get. And we got oh, sheriff. Okay, I'm down for this. All right, so the only person in this room that I know of is Charlie's, so let's let's go see if Charlie's in here. Oh, my God. What? Zach is dead. Wait, who just killed if? Charles, are you the murderer? No, I just ran from that room over there, bro, and I just heard oh, my God. Oh, my God. Who killed Zack? Was it you? I just in Sydney, Aunt did you kill him? Are you serious about that? It was one of you guys. Were you in the room before Zack? I was here. 
I've been here, but Zack just died. Are you innocent? Yes, I'm innocent. Okay. What are you? What are you yo, that means there might be another person loaded in this round. We should look around a little bit here. Do you think Sanders here? Dude, do you think somebody might be in your room? I mean, I guess, possibly. I don't know. I don't know. It could be just some random guess or something. I don't know. You better not be the murderer. All right, let's check your room, bro. I really hope it's not the murderer in your room. The murderer is in my room. That would really suck. You think it's that? What was that? What was that? Oh, God. What was that? The murder, I think, is out there. Oh, gosh, bro. Wait, so there's nobody in here? Wait, what about inside this closet? Do you think there's somebody in there, maybe. Possibly? No, just my closet. Okay, Charles. All right. Let's see what's going on in that oh, what was that? 
Hello? Wait, what is that? Anne Ann? No. Wait, if Anne's dead and Charlie disappears oh, my gosh. I got sheriff. Hey, what's up, Joe? How's it going? We spawned, literally, right at the same area. All right, so I guess we got to look around. Yeah, let's find the murderer. Yeah, we could shoot him. I didn't notice. You were right next to me. Okay, so anybody over here? Oh, my gosh. What is this? Just a new map. Just a new map. Oh, my God. This is a fortnight map. I don't know. We might have broke the map. They might have updated a little bit wrong this time. There's nothing over here. Okay, you freaked me out, man. I just tweaked it. Okay. All right. Let's go downstairs and see if there's any murderer. 
Hey, what's up, yo? What are you doing over there, man? You got a ball? Oh, very cool. Yo, can I hold that, bro? Did you buy it? No, I didn't buy it. Forgot. I didn't buy it. You didn't? Wait, guys, who's that ant? Is he an AFK ant? What the heck, dude? Just he's AFK, bro. Let's troll him, bro. Okay. All right, so that means wait a minute. Aren't we all the people in the game right now? Yeah, I think so. Where's the murderer? I just have my ball. I guess we got to keep searching. All right, let's go. Let's check the other side of the map. All right, guys, here we are. This is the other part of the map, guys. Oh, my goodness. All right, well, it's crazy. Wait, Joe. 
Oh, sweet, bro. Sweet, bro. Oh, your sheriff. That sucks. This is awkward, bro. You guys want the gun? I mean, I got to win this round, but I lost the last one because of you. You want to get the gun? Just go get it. Go get it. Go in. Look at that. Wait, what? Joe. You want to pick it up next? You want it? No. Oh, gosh. Joe, come back here. Come back here, Joe. Joe. Joe, come back here. Idiots. Joe, what are you doing? Joe, stop it. Come on, man. You're the last one. You're the last one. Oh, man. I got innocent, bro. Yo, Joe, what the dude, you're so obviously the sheriff, bro. 
Like, you have the biggest skin in the game. You're just holding a gun, and you have a sheriff hat. I'm here to save people. All right, well, dude, yeah, I'm going to stay by you because I'm innocent, bro. That sounds like something a murderer would say. What? I'm innocent, bro. He's doing nothing. Yeah. Wait. He's literally doing nothing. No, but I think he's AFK. Zack, he's not replying. Look, talk to him. He's AFK, bro. Wait a minute. He's the only other one in the game. He's got to be the murder. He's obviously AFK. No one's murdered anyone. He's AFK. Murderer. What? I would have tried to kill you by now. I'm gonna kill you. No, stop it. Joe, he's AFK. You have to get him. Joe. Joe. Joe, you don't know okay, that's good. Joe, please stop. Joe. 
Joe, you missed. Joe, please, I swear. I swear. Joe, you keep missing your aim. It's your aim, Joe. Kidnapp, bro. Joe, please. Joe. Joe, you're going to kill me, aren't you? Joe, you're making a mistake, dude. Seriously, don't kill me, bro, please. I don't think I'm making a mistake here. I'm innocent, dude. Seriously, dude. No, you won. You won. Oh, my gosh. Wait a minute, guys. I never realized we played Murder Mystery in real life, and I've never thrown a knife. You think you're safe? You think you're safe, Joe? You think you're safe? You think you're safe? You think you're safe? Do you know how illegal this is? Oh, man, I got to feel bad about that. Jeez. But I won. 
Oh, my gosh. Wait a minute. Is this a new map, bro? Where that yo ants? What's up, dude? Wait, this is this is the new the new your house map? Oh, no. Are you murderer, bro? All right, well, that means there's somebody else here. At least one or two other people are in here, so I guess we should let's check out the new map, man. There's a new update. So what's in here? Okay. Wow. Look at the boyfriends. This is your desk. How did they get in here? Did they just redesign the map and just I'm kind of tweaking out, bro. What else is what the heck, dude? I can't ride it because I have to spend Robuck on screw that, bro. That's a lot of Robucks, too, for a vehicle. All right, bro, so your roommate's, Michael, that means he's probably on this map. Let's check his room out. Okay. All right, let's see his room. He might be in there, man. He could be the murderer, though. Be careful when you're walking in there, right? What is that? What is that one murder weapon? Oh, my gosh. Oh, it's a bagscratcher. 
I thought it was a weapon for a second. He's like, what? There no, he's not. He's just okay, he's not in his chair as he in the bathroom. No, he's not in there. I don't know, man. I feel like I'm a cat or something. No. Are you? I'm innocent, bro. Okay. Wait. Whoa. What is this? Is that a weapon? Wait, that's a gun. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shoot. I'm not the murderer. Don't shoot me. Don't shoot me. Wait a minute. That's a fake gun. What? Oh, my gosh. You got me, bro. All right, man. Well, there's only one more room. The murderer has got to be in there, man. Unless you're the murderer or something like that. All right, man. Anyone in? Whoa. Michael. Michael, what are you doing in there? Michael, are you why you why are you not coming out, bro? You're tweaking me out, dude. Where are you? What? Michael, why are you the murderer? Michael, you must be the murderer. 
Why are you acting so weird? We're definitely innocent, bro. Like, what are you doing in here, dude? I don't know, man. I'm just too scared. Like, I'm camping. I have to camp, dude. What? I don't know, man. How do we not know you were Afghan? Do what? Why is he framing me? What? Oh, my he was a sheriff. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. I got it away. I got to get away. I'm calling the elevator. Oh, my gosh. Another new map end. Guys, I got murderer. Oh, hey, look at the cat, too. Oh, my gosh. It's a cat on this map. Hey. Hey, how's it going? Hey. Hey. Are you the murderer? Okay, I don't think she's the murderer, guys. All right, so let's check this map out, and let's see what players are on the map as well. Oh, my gosh. This thing is so cool. Look at this view. What's up, man? Okay. Do you think he's the murderer? 
No. Well, then you might are you the murderer? No, you just killed him. You just killed him. But you're not a murderer. No. No, you're not a murderer, but you killed him, right? That's pretty much what I'm thinking. I mean, he was dead before I got here. We'll take advice. All right, well, do you think well, there might be a guy in there. I'm innocent. Me, too, bro. I feel like the murderer is right in there right now. Are you the murderer? No. What about this guy? I'm just scared of the dark. Oh, my gosh. I'm scared of Garfield, man. All right, Joe. That was terrifying. Anyway. Oh, yeah, I forgot about her. Okay. All right, so is there anyone else on this map? Oh, wow, zach, how's it going, bro? What? Why? Okay, well, that's an interesting gun. All right. Wait, did you guys just hear that? 
Somebody just knocked at the door. Wait a minute, dude, that's got to be the murderer. Be careful. Be careful. Open the door. Open the door. Open the door. Open the door. Joe. Joe. Open it. Joe. Joe. Where did Joe go? Wait, no. He might be the murderer. Bro, I'm kind of scared. You want to look around the rest of this place? Yeah. All right, well, I guess we'll just oh, my God. What happened? What happened? Don't go out there. Why? Oh, no, it's fine. Why? I just bought the murder. I was I was trying to tweak you guys out. Oh, wait. All right, guys, so where have we not checked so far? Open up my room to check. Oh, yeah, let's check your room. Where did you spawn, by the way? I phoned right over here. Hold on. I got this. Hello? Murderer. I've never been to this side of the map. New addition. Oh, sorry. It's just lost. 
Okay. I don't know why I'm so jumpy today. All right, so anyways guys, wait. Did you guys is somebody knocking at the door again? Bro? Dude, what? Guys, there's no one there. Guys, I'm freaking out. Guys. Why is this cat by the knives right now? It's kind of a little suspicious. I think she might be man, that's what is that? She's the murder. You're wrong. Xbox gun. Okay, so if you don't think she's the murderer, Joe, I have a question. Can you stand right here? Because I think that there's, like, something on the ground right there that says, you're dead back, Zacked. Don't shoot me, bro. Don't shoot me. Wait, what? That's literally an Xbox or choke. That's not even a gun at all. That's not even a skin. Zach, you didn't do dang it, bro. 
Innocent? Really? Are you kidding me? Even real life? Yo, yo. What's up, Zach? How's it going, bro? I'm innocent, bro. What are you I am sure oh, my gosh. What is that? The new banana skin? That's awesome. Oh, my gosh. All right, so yo, where's Joe, bro? What's up? He might not be playing. He's he's not playing mm two today? Really? What does that mean? We're the only ones playing. That doesn't make sense. One of us has to be murderer. Joe? Joe, are you in here? Joe, are you playing mm two? Joe? Joe? What was that? Who is that? Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh. Is that michael? He's dead. Wait, that means the murderer is somewhere wait, let's check inside the closet. He's dead. Keep that gun. Keep that gun. There's no one in here. They might use ghosts. They might have used the ghost perk. We got to get out of here, bro. We got to get out. Okay, all right, so he might have moved somewhere else. 
Oh, my gosh. It's a cat. He might have moved somewhere else, so dude, keep that gun out, all right? Oh, that's a bike. My bad, my bad. I'm sorry. Okay, well, that gun is getting a little bit different looking. Is it changing skin? Very cool. Okay. All right. So I guess this is the only other place the murderer could be, bro. So the murderer must have those perks. So they must be are they murderer? There's nothing in there. There's no one in there. Wait a minute. I have an idea. What? What is your idea? My idea is hold on. Wait. That's your gun. You're eating your gun. Why are you eating your gun? No, the point is, Tommy, all right, she's really going to have on this gun. So what I was gonna say was Michael might actually he might not be there. What? Wait, what do you mean? The dead did you say he was using the dead perk, maybe? 
Because, I mean, yeah, he might be the only other player, bro. So here. Wait. Okay. Oh, God. All right, you got your gun. Oh, jeez. Nothing really there. Wait, what the yo, what? Wait, what? Here, he drops like he's gone. Zach. What? Oh, gosh. No, no, guys. Oh, my gosh. Oh, I got hit. Oh, no. What? No. Why did reset. Oh, my gosh. Are you kidding me? Yo, Zach, you're not going to believe what happened. Dude. Michael, dude, listen. Oh, you got a new skin. Oh, that one's a little bit disgusting, bro. Why did you change that skin? All right, well, anyways, I got terrible news. As you can see, I'm the murderer. But please don't shoot yet. I got to tell you something, bro. Seriously, don't. So, Michael, Reset, we're the only ones alive. We got to have a fair one v. One, bro. 
It's only fair. So I say you start over there, and I'll start in this corner over here. And then we'll have a one v. One. All right, that's okay. It still works, I think. I hope. Well, it is a banana. All right, are you ready for this? One v one. All right. Three, two, one. Player two. Oh, my gosh. I got innocent, bro. Are you kidding me? Wait, who are you, man? What? Where'd he go? What? Oh, guys, I think I just saw the murderer. That guy literally had ghosts. Oh, gosh, this is scary, man. Like, seriously, guys, where did he go? I have no idea. And also, it looks like we've got my place as the map, which means I have no idea who's going to be in this round with us. Guys. Like, who do you guys think the murderer was? Comment down below. But anyways, we got to be very careful because we're innocent. 
This round, we're not sheriff, which means there's got to be a sheriff in here as well somewhere. So we got to find that sheriff so that we can keep ourselves safe, guys, from that murder that we just saw. All right, so let's look around here a little bit. All right. There's nobody in here. Just in the kitchen. There's Thunder the Dragon over there. That's kind of cool. I'm anyone over here hiding? No. All right, guys, I'm freaking out right now. Okay, so it doesn't look like there's anybody here in this main room. Right now it looks like we're pretty safe. Nobody's hiding under anything, so I guess let's go in here. Okay, that is my reflection, man. I don't know why my reflection always scares me. All right, so let's go in here and check the shower. All right, nobody's in there, and what why is my door closed to my room, guys? That's weird. I never closed this door. All right, I have another door on the other side, so let's check out the other door, guys, and let's see what's going on. Maybe we can get in from that way instead of oh, gosh, guys, this door is closed too. I don't know if I want to go. Did you guys just hear that? 
Someone just got murdered in there. I swear I heard a gunshot, and I just heard a knife as well. Like, guys, I don't know. Should I go in there, man? Like, I'm freaking out right now. All right, guys, well, we got to do what we got to do, so let's just go in. Hello? Is anyone in here? Oh, my gosh. Somebody's dead. Somebody was murdered, guys. All right, I don't know who this is, but what is that? Looks like a banana. Oh, it's a gun. It's a gun on it. Oh, my all right, guys, this was the sheriff. Rest in peace, buddy. I don't know who you are, but you kind of fat. But anyways, guys, where's the murderer? All right, guys, we've got the gun, but to be honest, I don't really feel safe. Like, look at that guy down there. He did not end up too well. And that murderer definitely has ghosts, so I don't know where they went. They could be anywhere in here, guys. Okay. Oh, did you guys just hear that noise? 
Guys, there's somebody knocking at the front door. Guys. Guys, who do you think it is? Oh, gosh. Guys, I'm scared. Comment down below who you think the murderer is? Somebody who's knocking at the door. All we know is that the murderer has ghosts and that he killed this guy over here, and this is how we got the gun. All right, so, man, I don't know if I want to answer this door or not, man. I'm kind of freaking out right now. I'm really not sure about this guy. Let's double check and make sure our corners and he's not behind us or anything. Dude, the cat scared me, man. Oh, my gosh. I don't think dude, the cats. The murderer. All right, guys. Oh, gosh, they just knocked again. They just knocked again, guys. All right, I guess we're going to have to answer the door. Oh, gosh. All right, here goes nothing. Guys. What? What? There was no one there. Guys, I just heard my bedroom door just closed. 
Like, I left that open, I swear. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. We got to get the gun. All right, guys, we got to check out my room. Oh, gosh, man. Oh, gosh. Here we go.

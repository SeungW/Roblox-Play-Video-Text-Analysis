In this video, we unlock every single thing you can unlock in Roblox Pizza Factory Tycoon. We start with no pizzas or supplies and end up building a max level blue pizza printer. Whoa, look at how sick they look. Dude, there's blue pizzas. We start with no restaurant and end up with a fully maxed out store with tons of super rare foods. We even get the max level pizza UFO, one of the rarest vehicles in the whole game, and we show you how we do it. Let's go. What is up, guys? Welcome to this episode of Lucky VOD. Today we're seeing Wingo max level in Roblox Pizza Factory. Tycoon Whoa. We're making a pizza factory, bro. Yeah, we got to have the best factory ever. Okay, I'm going to start building. I'm going to claim this. Now I got to select a pizza factory slot. Okay. Okay, nice. Let's go. Wow. Start building. We got the pizza. Fire. Whoa. Click. Pizzas to earn money. We got to bake the pizzas, though. Adam, we don't have pizzas. Oh, pizza. 

Pizza. I love pizza. Wait, we don't have any money. We don't have anything. Oh, the pizza is coming out. What's that? Square pizza. Looks like a sandwich. Where are you getting square pizzas from? I don't know. Okay, wait, I need 150. Oh, I have it. I haven't base cutter. Wait, what? That didn't do anything. Wait, but your money is still at zero, huh? No, because I spent on a base cutter. Now I'm getting tomato. Adder. It's going to add to my oh, wait, so I upgraded. Now it circles. Oh, it did do something. It just took some time. So I get it. Now. The circular pizzas probably give you more money because they're better, and then once they have tomatoes on them, they'll be even better. Exactly. I got to collect. I got to collect. I got to collect. All right, we got $300. Nice. Now they give you $75 each pizza. $300 from some pizza. Wow, this is great. This is going really well. Dude, think about if someone paid you to eat pizza. What? Yeah, that would be my dream. Okay, I would go get the tomato added now. 

Guys, we're going to check out the shop. Oh, okay. I've unlocked. Rookie cook. Let me check in the shop. There's probably okay. You can just buy money. You could buy multipliers. You get VIP. That's it. That's all you could buy. So that's actually not that much stuff that we can buy. Wow. Oh, whoa. We've got sauce on it. Dude, that looks like a yummy pizza. That looks like how Adam eats his pizza. He scrapes off everything except the cheese. I got to get the cheese adder. I had him here. Yeah, this is sick, man. All right, let's go. All right, I got the cheese adder. Oh, wow. So, yeah, guys, in this video, we are going to try to upgrade our pizza factory tycoon to the max level. We're going to buy everything, and that might mean spending quite a few robots. We're definitely going max level, dude, they just print the cheese. Wait, what? That one missed the cheese. Print the cheese. Nice. What? I think you might have gotten scammed. No, some of them had cheese. What just happened? No, no. My cheesy pizzas. 

Okay. I got a bunch of money, though. Each piece is worth $125. Wow. Okay, that's pretty good. Hey, I got totally scammed with the cheese machine, but that's okay. Powered funnel. What's that? I need 2000. $2,000. 2000. Now as we wait for the $2,000 oh, I can get walls. Okay, I'll get walls. Oh, that's pretty good. Wait, that's so expensive. Wait a yo. No, guys, I got to focus on trying to make the pizzas worth more, because then I'll make more money quicker, right? Dude, this game is actually difficult, and you already know all the thick punches. Kind of look like pizzas. I'd be tossing pizzas, bro. Yeah, you're right. I'm chef justy I toss pizzas. Okay, I think I got $2,000. Wow, nice. Powered funnel. Oh, wait. What the heck did that do? It added all this stuff, so it's going to go faster. Oh, it makes a conveyor quicker. And now we got wait, what? The cheese flew off. It was going so fast. Wait, what the heck? The cheese flew off? It was going so fast. And now there's no cheese on it at all? No. Okay, I will get it. Don't worry. I will get all the cheesy pizzas. At least they're worth more, though, now. 

Yeah, it makes sense. Nice. We're getting all kinds of turbo pizzas. Why? $4,000? How much are they worth now? 125. Still 125. Oh, the turbo just made it go faster. Oh, guys, I mean, we're going to try and get to the point where our pizzas are worth, like, thousands of dollars. Our pizzas are going to be worth zillions of dollars. Yeah. Okay, we're zooming. We're zooming. All right, now I'm going to go over here. I'm going to leave the turbo funnel. What's this? Slide walls, entrance. Okay, get the entrance past amount of money. Was that worth it? That was worth it. Yeah, it looks cool. All right. Yeah. I'm out of money, though. Trying to make some more pizzas. Yeah, I just got to eat the pizza is eat them. Eat them. Yeah. Now, there were some multipliers we could buy. I'm not going to do it, Adam. I'm not going to do it. I know you're tempted. No, I'm not. I'm not going to spend robots. Okay. I'm not going to do it. I'm pretty sure Jessica going to spend some robots. We're going to do a fair square. All right. Fair square is going to be great. Here we go. Here we go. Dude, the pizzas. I'm getting to the pizza dance. Okay, we're doing the pizza dance, and it's about to get saucy. 

Very saucy. Okay, now I need like 2000 more dollars or something. All right. Okay. I don't know where to get more money. We're just waiting on the pizzas. Yeah, I mean, starting your own pizza shop would probably be pretty trusty. What? Tricky, huh? It'd probably be pretty tricky. Everybody please go lakeybox shop. He needs to get an education. Adam, you need education, man. For real. It's not a joke anymore, bro. Maybe it's because I haven't been eating enough pizza. That's probably what you need to eat more pizza. Pizza is brain food, guys. All food is brain food. Exactly. Yeah. Okay, now I see the pizza. So it starts out a dough. That's pretty cool. Starts out a square dough. It gets turned to a circle, then it gets the sauce, then it gets the cheese. Except we got scammed on the cheese. Oh, that's pretty cool, though. Can we add toppings? Probably, right? There's probably going to be like a pepperoni machine, stuff like that. 

I wish I had a pepperoni machine. Yeah, at home. That'd be pretty cool. Well, now I know what you get you for your birthday. What? A pepperoni yeah. Holland. That would be cool. Yeah, I know. Okay, now I'm one pizza away or two pizzas away from getting the Turbo Funnel. Turbo funnel, guys. All right, we're going to see if this increases the price of our pizza or just makes them quicker. How are we going to make it quicker? You're going to make a zoom. Zoom. Whoa. Now they're cheesy. Now they're cheesy. Okay, here we go. Cheesy bread. But then they end up not cheesy stopping. Yeah, it's kind of weird. Okay, it's cheesy. It's cheesy. It's not cheesy. Why do you do that, bro? It's like it's too cheesy that it just melts off. I don't really know what the Turbo Funnel did. I guess it's going faster. I think so. Okay, we gotta get 6000 for the double funnel. Okay, I can't afford anything. I get four floor. Whoa. Oh, the floor looks good. Okay, that was pretty worth it. Guys, we're going to finish this entire game no matter what. Yeah, we're gonna finish the entire game in this video. 

It's gonna be lit. Let's go. Let's go. Although it would be probably pretty tricky for you to start your own pizza shop because you probably just eat all the pizza before giving it to the customer. What? No, I won. No, the customer always comes first. Added. The customer is always right. I will be my own customer. You would pay yourself? That's genius, dude. I could pay myself and I would get infinite pizzas and infinite money. Think about think about it. That's smart. Infinite money hack. Infinite money pizza hack, bro. That's smart. That is pretty smart. Yeah. Big bray. I got a counter. Oh, can I hire, like, an employee? Oh, you've almost rookie server. Rookie server. Okay. Pizza creation station. Wait, how much is it? 1200.

What's the most expensive topping? The most expensive is which? We will get an extra chain or squid the squid game pizza. Squid pizza. Okay, wait, so how do I get gems? Probably from customers, right? Yeah, it's got to be Tycoon Teleport. This probably takes me home, right? Yeah, most likely home. Do I have it up now? Hello? Hello. Yeah, we really got to hire a chef. How do I get pizza? Storage facility. What's this? There's a back room where they put our content out here. What's that? Our content is not why they do that, bro. Why? I got a dumpster right next to the pizzas. That's not sanitary. Well, then if you mess up or drop any on the ground, you could just throw it away. That's not Sandy. Terry for the dairy. 

Scary Larry. Sanitary. Well, I never thought about it that way. That's what I'm saying. You need to think about it more. You need to think about your life.

How do I get I need a pizza. Clicker. Oh, so this guy will pick up the pizzas for me. Auto collect.

One seat dessert stools. Whoa. So it's like a two storey store, so you can go downstairs, get your normal pizza, and then for dessert, you go upstairs and make, like, a fond. Dude, we got a chocolate fountain. Yummy. Always wanted one of these in real life. Yeah, normally what we do is I just have Adam hold the Hershey's bottle and squeeze it, and I use that. Yeah, he calls it a Hershey waterfall. It's really good. Yeah, it's really good. I'm not very good at Amy, though, so it normally makes a big mess, and my mom does not like it. 

Yeah, adam gets carried away. He starts throwing on the wall. I don't know why he gets in trouble. Not me. Yeah, because you just run away. It's not my fault. I'm not dealing with this. Got sprinkles on the walls. Wow. Sprinkles. Wall extension. Okay, our rating is going up, but we're spending a lot of money on decorations and stuff. I want to spend it on pizzas, bro. We got a lot of gems. I guess we got to go back to the store and get all the different pizzas. I mean, you could probably get, like, every single topic. I think so I'm going to get on my bike. Oh, it's stuck. What? Come on. Come on, glitchy. Nice. Okay, I go straight through the woods to the store. Wow. Nice. Dude, I know. The supermarket's over here. Nice. I hope nobody's ringing the phone, because I'm not there to deliver, and I'm not taking any deliveries right now. Yeah, we got to hire someone to pick up the phone. Yeah, we got to do that. All right, I get mushrooms, ham, olives. I already have chicken. 

All right. I would get tomato, bacon, bell pepper, top peppers, pineapple, beet, beef, barbecue sauce. I'm getting everything, bro. Yeah, good idea. We got shrimp on pizza. Oh, I would love shrimp on my pizza. What? I like shrimp. Adam does love shrimp. Wow. We have just enough gems to do that. Yeah. That was great. My bike is stuck again. My bike is stuck again. Oh, it's a little glitchy. Okay. I'll just teleport home. Oh, no. Wow. It's probably a little trickier because it doesn't have training reels like the ones you have. Yeah. Yeah, it was so funny. Yeah. At least I get to ride my bike. Yeah, I'm banned from riding bike. Yeah, bro. You sit in the stroller? Yeah. Why? I sit in the wagon. That's my wave. You're not allowed to ride. I forgot about the leash. Yeah, you're either on a leash or in the stroller. Sometimes both. Yeah, he tried to make a run for it. 

No, not today, Adam. Yeah, it's one of those cool leashes with, like, the extendable thing. You know, you click the button. It's not actually, it's not. All right, just a piece of string. I get the cool one. Weird flex, but okay. Yep. All right, I'm zooming. Wow, look at all the different types of pizza, but I have to make each one. I guess it's work. We're trying to make a restaurant. Yeah, you got to end up putting in that work if you want to have a successful restaurant. You need to put in that work if you want to accessible English. And I am by reading the Lanky Box take adventure book. You almost made it past the first page, Adam. Yeah. Okay. This isn't taking a lot of work, bro. We got to make every single pizza. Why wouldn't you just make them? I got to name them. 

I really wish that you could hire someone to do this. I know, but I don't think we can. Well, we don't need to make all of them ham. Yeah, I do. I need the full pizza collection. We said we unlock everything, Adam. Oh, I guess you're right. See, Adam likes to give up, bro. Would you be given up for now? Wait a minute. Could you put multiple toppings on a pizza? What? I didn't even think about that. You can't. I'll make it everything pizza. Yeah. The Supreme Pizza. Okay, supreme. So this gets 15 gems. Yeah. Wait, that's actually this game is so cool. You can mix and match what you want. Oh, so you get four toppings per pizza? Yeah, dude, you can't use more than four ingredients. Okay, dude, this is a pineapple mix. That was yummy. Dude, this is sick. I didn't know. Wait, doesn't that mean there's, like, an infinite number of pizzas we can make? Like, literally infinite? Yeah, close to infinite. A ton, right? Wow. 24 gems per pizza. That's so tuna. 

That sounds questionable. Dude, with this shrinking off and prawns shrinking off and corn prawns, you would eat this? Well, I like going to corn mazes, but I don't know if I'd like a shrimpy corn. I love eating corn. Yeah. Can I have a Sasha delivered to house? What? Oh, there's so many deliveries. Can I have a cheese pizza delivered house three? Okay, I got you, I got you. All right, well, you really got to have a good mind so you can memorize all the order. Yeah, don't worry. I got a good mind. Yeah. All right, let me get out. Can get it. Can I respawn the bike? I need it. Yeah. Nice. All right. Okay. This is pretty sick. I think we've unlocked almost everything, bro. I'll be honest. Yeah. Okay, nice. This person's here. Nice. That was really quick. Now the only thing I can think to unlock is what was in the mechanics. Yeah. The Sci-fi base. Yeah. So we will try to unlock that. Guys, we got to do this. This game is lit, bro. I'll be honest. I love this game. Wow. I wonder what the Sci-Fi pizza base is going to look like. There was stuff upstairs to do the dessert pizza. I forgot. Yeah, nobody's bought a dessert pizza yet. Sprinkled wall extension. 

Sure. Okay. Roof donut lights. Whoa, whoa. They're donut lights. I want those in my room. Yeah, we should go on those in real life. I have to create dessert pizzas. Oh, you have to buy the dessert pizza ingredients. There's so much content in this game. This is sick. Wait, no, there's no dessert pizzas. Huh? Hey, is it in the freezer? I don't get it. Where do you buy dessert pizzas? Maybe just try putting on, like, meatballs on the dessert pizza. Oh, what's that in the middle? What's that? Buy dessert ingredients. Oh, this is a random guy out here with ice cream. Okay. I can buy toppings from him. Oh, and these are more expensive jelly beans. You can get, like, all these. You have so many gems. I cannot buy everything. I'll get lemon drizzle. Yeah, yummy. Lemon drizzle. A gingerbread. Buy all the most expensive ones until I run out of money. I mean, we're going to get most of them. Wow, this is such a sick game. 

This game is one of my new favorites on Roblox, bro. Yeah. I can't wait to see how the dessert pizzas look. I love Robox, bro. I love Roblox with all my heart, bro. Yeah. I love you. What? That might have something to do with the song. I love you very much. We all love my mom, and we all love the plushies and the new Langy Box book. I love you, Foxy. Yeah. Foxy's, my best friend. So is thick shark. Yeah, so is Boxy. Foxy boxy and ghosty. Yeah. And sticky and candy. And thick, sticky and Candy and the book all My Friends and the Squishy. Okay, hold on. To make a pizza hey, yo. There you go, buddy. There you go. All right. Got to create some pizza. Okay, I'm going to just mix everything, bro. I'm going to mix the most expensive strawberry laces, extra sugar, jam, white chocolate chunks. OOH, that's it. That's, like, 45 gems. 

All right, so now we're going to get pretty rich. Now we're going to make all kinds of dessert. Pizzas, man. All right, I'm just going to combine everything, bro. Sure. Wow. We're going to have, like, the best pizza shop in all of Roblox. That's what I'm trying to do, bro. We try to do our best at everything. Yeah. All right, here we go. Rhubarb. What's rhubarb? Rhubarb, I think, is like, a vegetable. What? Like rhubarb pie. What's that? It's kind of like a pumpkin, I think. What? So you know how you can make pumpkin pie? Yeah. You can make rhubarb pie. It's pretty similar. Okay. Yeah, it's pretty yummy. Bananas. Cool. Yeah. Nobody's up here, though. Oh, somebody's up here. Ayo. Okay, cool. Just by himself, sitting in with Adam, sitting at the restaurants. Oh, the bootstoon go to Applebee. I think we maxed out everything. I think we go and change the blueprint based on the mechanic. Yeah, good idea. What is this room for? There's nothing to build in here. It could be, like, a party room. Oh, like a birthday room. 

Exactly. I get it, I get it. They want the beef. Wow. I want the rub arm. Wow. Yeah. I'm not taking any deliveries right now. I think we maxed out everything you can buy in this game. All right, guys, let's see if we can get that Sci-Fi pizza shop unlocked. This game is so cool. Okay, the mechanic, once again, is just missing in action. Here we go. Come on, come on, come on. Bye. We combine. We got it. Whoa. Your tycoon has sci-fi button. We can now unlock a mysterious lab. Wait, what? Wasn't there, like, a bunker before? What? Remember when you were so we could make a goal there? Yeah, but wait, I'm thinking wait, is there something, a building here? Maybe this is what that room is for. I don't know. No way. Is it this? No. I guess we go to the bunker. Yeah. What do we guys, let us know the comments were we supposed to do? I'm not really sure. I think I know. We have to go to the town center, the sound center, because there was something about, like, some Sci-Fi bunker there. Guys, there was. I know I saw it. Here we go. I'm zooming, I'm zooming. Here we go. 

All right, let's see what's over here. It's got to be right here, bro. Got to be right here. All right, I'm going in here. Buy ingredients. Oh, wow. We got new ingredients here. You have to get the dessert Sci-Fi pizza counter upgrade. How do you get that? It's got to be upstairs in your factory, right? Oh, it's on the roof. Yeah, it's a third story. Wow. And I bet maybe after the Sci-Fi, it's going to be a pirate pizza, which would explain the pirate ship. Are you serious? Yeah. I didn't see any more blueprints. I think this is the max level. Oh, okay. Wait. How do I get up there, though? Probably have to go inside. No, there's no stairs in there. Oh, how do I get up there? Well, there was an ingredient on the pizza treats station. What? Really? Yeah, the dessert pizza. I didn't see it. I don't think there's a pirate thing because it would say it here. I think this is it. Custom upgrades, upgrade skins. It just looks cooler. Oh, okay. 

It just looks like sci-fi. I got it. Okay. This is pretty cool. Okay, the mechanic not looking too good. That's okay. Okay, here we go. Where do we go? You saw something up here? I think that's what it said to do. Are you messing with me? No. Go to the counter. Okay. And then I thought it said go here. Okay. Create pizza and your mind is a web bag. I thought it said it when you went in the bunker to do something around here. I'm so confused, bro. There's probably another level above here, but I don't see it. Bro. We also have, like, a million coins, but nothing to spend them on. How do we get up there? What? What? And we're stuck at 3.6 stars. How do we go higher level? Oh, do something here. Wait, really? Wow, I missed that. Starbase cutter. Starbase, dude, it's gonna make pizzas in the shape of stars. Are you serious? To Mars. Blue cheese. Blue cheese. Laser powered plasma. Whoa. Look at how sick they look. Rocket panels. Are you serious? 

Wait, this is lit. We're making, like, the pizza planet from the movie. What? Dude, there's blue pizzas. Blue outer space pizzas. This is what I ate when I was on the spaceship. Really? They fed you these attractive beam? That doesn't sound that bad. It was pretty good. Yeah, it was pretty good. Wow, this is so sick. And now that wait, there's more to build over here. Wow. Wait, stuff cross beat. I love STUFFCROSS. Oh, wait, so now we can get the Sci-Fi stuff. Oh, we replace the mechanic with this guy. Okay. Okay. Okay, we're zooming. Wow. Keep your eyes peeled like somebody is there anything to build? Yep, over here. There's still so much stuff to build. Scifi entrance. So I think this just replaces everything. It just looks look it just looks different. Yeah, that's pretty cool, dude. I'm gonna get some scifi toppings, and then I think I'm good. Okay. Okay. Got yeeted. Whoa, these tables are sick. Yeah, they're like holograms. What? Wow. Yo, and wait we go. 

Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Hey, yo. Okay. Yeah, we got we got some new, so it's just changing the appearance of everything. Oh, so now we can store the scifi pizza? Yeah, exactly. Okay. Scifi booms. Wow. St, bro, I don't have enough money. I got to get enough money. Our money's gone up a lot. Like, a few thousand every second. Here we go. Okay, that was pretty cool. That was just grass. Okay, I'm gonna go get some ingredients. Good idea. Let's go, dude. Let's go get on the robbery bike. Wow. 20,000 gems is what Justin has. Let's go, dude. Let's go. All right. I wonder what the toppings are going to be in the Sci-Fi world. Yeah, dude, it's going to be nuts. I can already tell. All right, here we go. All right, please work this time. What? I still didn't get it. Oh, I got to buy the dessert. Okay, I get it now. We can wait. Hoyt. Test tube chemicals. 

Hoyt. That's literally the stuff that Justin has. That's what I was put in. Yeah, I'm gonna get all the most expensive ones. Get them all. Laser peppers. Oh, wow. Good thing we have so many cosmic silk. Oh, no way. Are there chickens in space? Yeah, there are. I know. I've seen them. That's so cool, dude. A good thing we had so many gems because we needed those. Yeah, I think we literally got everything now. Let's go back home. I think we beat we literally beat everything. Yeah, I think this is it, guys. This is it. We're going to go change the toppings to be crazy, bro. No way. To get the seat extensions. Wow, look at their hovering. Oh, wow. Okay. So cool. That's got to be one of the coolest pizza places ever. Well, we got bathrooms. That scifi, bro. Dude, it's like you're in a spaceship. We got a scifi bathroom, bro. Final storage. All right, can I make more pizzas now? Yeah, create pizzas. Oh, yes, a cheese pizza. I don't want that. I'm going to make pizzas. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Dude, is it going to let us make crazy Sci-Fi pizza? 

No, you got to make these upstairs. Oh, what? All right, guys, we got to make some crazy Sci-Fi pizzas. Then I think we will have beaten this game. Yeah, that's our ultimate goal. All right, now, to do that, we have to build the counter upstairs, which means we have to finish everything in here. Oh, see, that's where I got confused before. Yeah, we're out of money. It's, like, blocked off. Oh, why? Oh, teleporter. Whoa. Wow. Yeah, we got to finish building all this, and once we get here, then we will get it. Should we buy money? No, bro. We only need a little bit. Okay. All right. We need a little bit. All right, well, I think we got to finish buying everything downstairs. Meanwhile, I can enjoy watching everybody like the food. Yeah. You want to buy some Robucks? Spent some Robucks. I think we should. I think we should. We made it this far. Brock, these are not even that useful, bro. I mean, that's a lot of money. All right, let's do this. Let's do this. That's not too bad. 120,000. That's not too bad. 

Let's go, guys. We're going to finish the game right here, guys. All right, here we go. We're going to finish the game right here. Let's go upstairs, see if we can finish everything upstairs. Sweet. Okay. Oh, yes. We did it. It's coming together. We did it. We can make it now. We can make it. We should be able to make it now. Or we can get those topics, at least. Yeah, as long as we can just get the topping. Wait, didn't we make it here before? Yeah, maybe we have to finish buying everything in the game before it lets us. You think so? I think so. All right. To do this. Oh, do fountain. Oh, what some slime. Oh, now they're like glitching. Okay. Yeah. Let's go downstairs. I think we got to build everything. You're right. Hoverboard. Whoa. That's a cool bike. Wait, that's lit. This is lit. This game is lit. What? Yo, what's this? We got to get this. We just got to wait. Oh, we don't have enough money. What is that? We can take deliveries. This is the last think I want to buy, dude, and then we're done. Okay. This is nuts, bro. This is going to be a game changer, bro. All right, we just need 45,000. 

You guys can see that's our money. It's going up to 40,000 right here. It's going to be there in, like, 2 seconds. I'm getting kind of stressed. Don't get stressed. It's a good thing you have the squishies. Yeah. Here we go. Here we go. Nice. Whoa. Oh, this is sad. Wow. Guys, leave a like and subscribe. Make sure you go check out Lankyboxshop.com. Get yourself the new Thick plushies, the book, the squishies, and all the other amazing merch we have there lankyboxshop.com. This is thick. This was worth playing the whole game for. This is the coolest vehicle I've ever seen in robots. Yeah, dude, I did remember that. I have to singing my song. Yeah, you have to do that. Well, if you don't want me to no, you could do it. Okay. All right. It's pretty short. I like you. You are sweet. You are my best feet. Took me about 3 hours to write that last night. Originally, I wrote it for Boxy, but basically any of the plushies that would work for. 

I'll proud you, bro. Yeah. I'll proud of you, bro, because I like boxy. I like foxy. I like everyone. Well, that was pretty sick, Adam. That was pretty sick. You're welcome. I was pretty sick. I'm going to go to a different dimension to escape the cringe.

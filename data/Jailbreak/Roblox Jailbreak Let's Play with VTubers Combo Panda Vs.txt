Yo, let's go. Alpha alexa. 
You just fell on the ground like that. Wow, that looks so funny. 
Combo funga. 
Alpha awesome sub. Combo wanna play jail break? 
Oh, on Roblox? 
No, in real life. Yes, in Roblox. 
Okay. Okay. Jeez. 
What did you think I wanted to go try break out of a real jail? 
Maybe you might be fun. 
I worry about you sometimes. 
Combo what's up, everybody? We're back. We're VTubers. I'm Combo Panda. 
And I'm Alpha Lexa. 
And we're on Roblox playing jailbreak today. Trampoline. Trampoline. 
Come on. 
The trampoline broke my bones. Alva, do you see what's going on with me? I'm just getting flung around whenever I go on this thing. Has it happened to you? 
Whoa. Oh, my goodness. It just happened to me. Yeah, I'm on the bench now. What are these things? 
I keep trying to jump on the. 
Treadmills and look like it won't it's just not letting me run. 
All right, punch this thing and we're escaping through here. 
Okay. 
All right, now you have to lift up the gate, and then you have to crawl. Do you know how to crawl? 
Yeah, I'm going to try my best. 
Yay. All right, we got to crawl out of here. They're not going to open the gate for us. Just watch out. There's a cop right over there. 
We're like Bonnie and Clyde. Oh, no. 
Except you're getting arrested. 
Oh, no. I'm back in this smelly jail cell. 
Whoa. Alpha, there's another way back here that we can break out where it's like everybody this, like, metal gate. You just need to come out to the yard. 
I'm going to find wherever that is because I definitely know where that is. 
Back here. Yay. Over here. Now I just got to explode this ball. He's quit punching me. God, pinch me. I'm not punching you. Someone else. I got arrested. Watch out. There's a copy. 
What? 
Run. 
I'm breaking up. You're right here. 
Alpha. Just leave without me. He's going after me. Go, Bonnie. 
Leaving anyone behind? 
Come on, Bonnie. I'm running. I got two copies on me. They're trying to taste me, bro. Don't take me, bro. 
Me. There's the SWAT car right here. Maybe. 
No, but don't get near me. Just run. Run. 
I'm running away. 
And now I'm arrested. 
Oh, there's another car right here. I'm going to go get it. I'm going to steal it. 
At least ELFA is going to make it away. 
We can start a new life together, Clyde. 
No. I'm still in jail. All right, here helping my car. Now we're finally out of jail. Together we're free. We're finally free, reunited. And it feels so good. All right, cool. We found somewhere we can break into. No. 
Get arrested again. 
Don't bring me out. Bring me out. 
No, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
No. You're going to get arrested by us. 
This guy has crazy green hair. He looks really scary. 
He looks like walk a flock of flame or something. 
What if we played as cops in the next one? No, I can play. 
We don't even get a jail break then we're just sending people back to jail. 
I would probably win if I was a cop because I would be busting you all the time. 
Yeah, just try to pickpocket one of. 
These cops, all right? I'm pickpocketing this guy. He has, like, a lot of muscles. 
We're talking about being a female buster. We've had enough of that last year. 
What? No, I got arrested again. How did you all were busting together? 
I just wanted to escape once, all right? I've had an epidemic. I'm not in jail anymore. 
Really? Are you a cop now? Are you a cop or something? 
Hey, how do you know what I did? 
Did you turn into a cop? 
I can't believe she always know what I'm doing. 
Oh, my gosh. This is the biggest betrayal of all time. 
No, I'm not betraying you. I'm going to kick you my cake. 
You are my Clyde. I was the body to your Clyde. 
Yeah. 
Oh, no, I got arrested again. 
Yeah, whatever. I mean, you could stay in the jail. I'm coming to break you out. Well, I'm not betraying you. 
Like you keep saying hero. My Clyde. 
My hero. Academia. What the heck? Some criminal against Ringer ended me, but I can't even catch up with him because the cop cars are too slow. 
I thought that combo panda pretending to be a policeman was one of the top ten anime betrayals of all time, but I'm giving him one more chance. 
One more chance, actually. Wait. Just follow me. Watch it. Watch. Come through this door over here. 
All right. 
This door. 
Okay. Dinnie dinner. 
Now we climb up the ladder like. 
A secret spy man. 
Yeah. And poptart. 
OOH, toaster Stroodle. 
Oh, those are better. 
Toaster stroodles are so warm and nice. 
And I like putting the frosting on them. 
Oh, is this always so fun? And the frosting and the strawberries. 
No. 
Did you just arrest me? 
No. Someone else did. 
That was a top ten anime betrayal of all time. 
No, he's wrapped in I can't trust you anymore. 
I don't know if you're even telling the truth. 
Someone called the Whambulance. We got a little baby over here. 
Ambulance. 
Wait. Call when someone's crying. There you are, Alpha. Come pickpocket me. Get the card. And if anyone else wants the card, feel free to take it. Little Jean. I got it. 
I got the card. You were telling the truth. 
Yo, just don't get arrested, okay? Alpha x actually, you know, it just tied while I'm a criminal. 
Okay, I'm going to hide. I'm going to hide right now. Think I can make it? Do you think I can make it off assassins? All right, I'm going for it. I'm going for it. 
All right, where are you, Alpha? I'm waiting in the yard. 
Oh, no. There's this guy, and I'm trying to run away from him. He's a scary copper, man. 
Oh. I didn't know you were outside. Okay, cool. Watch out. Avoid him. 
You became a prisoner again yes. For me? 
Yeah, just run away, though. You have a cartoon. 
You're so sweet. 
You still were playing the game quit making this we aid you became a. 
Prisoner for me again oh, my goodness. You are a true friend. 
I became a prisoner for roadblocks. Oh, come on. Poptite. No. Poptite. Pop tight. I can't come out of here. 
Try harder. 
At least the cop's not arresting me. Yo. Let's go, Alfalxa. 
You just fell on the ground like that? Wow. That looks so funny. 
Yay. We finally escaped again. 
You know what? I'm I'm pretty hungry. Maybe we should, like, grab a donut store first, so we can, like, eat a bunch of pineapple. Yeah, pineapple tuna don't. 
That's how we're going to run to a top. And now we're definitely going to get a reaction. 
Yeah. 
Let's do the baker. Or do you want to do the jewelry store? Can we not break in here? 
No, I don't think so. 
But you have the card key, right? 
I do. Okay. I'm trying to do it. It's not working. It's not. Maybe this isn't the right store. Maybe this is the right opening. 
I want to do the jewelry store. All right, let's go try the bank. 
Okay, let's go. 
I'm banking on the bank. All right. I punched my way into the bank. You following me, ELFA? 
Oh, no. What was that? 
Yay. Wait. What's over in this toy? It's just a bad alley. 
Is that a bad guy? 
Oh, no. Just come back in here. Hi. 
A bugatti. 
No, he's a bad guy. But he's a bad guy. Witch guy. Bad guys. A good guy. 
Good guys. That's a little weird. It's an opposite day. 
That's definitely a bad guy. No, you got arrested. Sorry, I'm weak, but I'm getting the money. No, I'm arrested. No, I'm arrested. I'm going back to jail with you, Alpha. Got to be honest. I'm still thinking about doing jailbreaking real life. 
It's not a good idea. 
Later, combo crew. Jailbreaking real life, here we come. Let's go.

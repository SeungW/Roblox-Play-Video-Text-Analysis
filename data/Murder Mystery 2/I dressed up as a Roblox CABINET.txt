Filing sorry, filing cabinet. Crate rock. So LCD uploaded, like, yeah, three new hide yourself type of heads. A couple other people did, too. There's the big box. You don't need a headless head for that. It's pretty cool. But everyone's gonna be doing this one because you don't need the headless head. Then it will defeat the purpose because everybody will know that you're trying to hide if you have that. Only 13 people have this right now, so all right, let me get my option on. Oh, yeah, one thing. I got beef with Roblox right now. Look at this. See the soulless, disgusting, pathetic smile? It won't let me wear the goofball face. Look, I click it. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop boop. He still remains a pathetic, soulless loser. I don't know why it won't let me wear the goofball face, but Cletus just, like, looks bad. It looks like someone killed Cletus and is trying to pretend to be Cletus. So I'll go back over here where I became. 
So basically, I have the headless head, which is 30,000 roebucks you can only get during Halloween. I got, like, certain arms, certain legs that make me smaller and they fit inside the box, but no box today. Piling cabinet. No shrub either. Piling cabinet. I am a simple island cabinet. So I'm going to go into murder mystery too. Maybe some other games. And I like Murder Mystery, too, because the murderer cannot see your name. So it's perfect to hide in here because if I'm a filing cabinet and I have Mr. Foot flam above my head, it's not going to make sense. I'll just look like an idiot trying to hide. But the murderer can't see your name. All right, so this is legitimately perfect. I could just pull up right here. I need to hide from everyone in the lobby first. Dude, it's so stressful hiding. That sounds so stupid, but it's stressful hiding from people in the lobby. I think my legs are actually too short because I'm, like, sinking into the ground a bit. Please, nobody come through here. 
I don't want anyone to know I'm a filing cabinet. It blends in really well. Say, I'm going to try the filing cabinet. I'm going to try the crate. I'm going to try what was the other one? A rock? I don't know. That's interesting. Also, shout out to Dysoft. He just uploaded this that literally looks like what's that one game? Identity Fraud. That looks like the bad guy from Identity Fraud. That's terrifying. Good job, Daisoft. No, no, he's going to see me. He's going to see me. This idiot. Oh, I hate you. I hate you, I hate you. Good thing is so Laggy, you probably didn't actually see me. Oh, it's kind of working. That guy just walked past me. Usually they kind of just go straight up to me and just start staring. Oh, God, I did hear someone die. You know, a filing cabinet would never go here, and it would never go slightly underground. I messed up something with the legs, but maybe uhoh that's a man. Uhoh, yeah. Usually when people notice that I'm trying to hide, they usually just kind of go right up to me and be like, whoa, look at that. And nobody's actually done that yet, so I think it's tricking everybody. 
Oh, God. Okay. Yeah. The murder is, like, killing everybody right now. I wish I had, like, an office to go to. Oh, God. It just gave me a coin. Stop. There's the murderer. Oh, God. No, it worked. It's working. It's working. Oh, my God. How am I going to get that? Oh, my God. It worked perfectly. Why would a filing cabinet go here? Okay, this looks better. I wonder if she'll notice the filing cabinet is no longer there. Whoa. Wonder if she'll notice the gun is gone. Well, you fool, I was there the whole time. How makes sense. Right back at it again. Oh, my God. I forgot to fix the legs. It's still sick. No, stop moving. It's still sunk it into the ground completely. Oh, no. There's a person with a gun. Stop it. So okay. 
I feel more scared of the noob with the gun compared to the murderer. Stop. It literally keeps moving. Stop. Oh, my God. Now this girl goes, okay, that's fine. It's fine if she knows. As long as the murderer doesn't know and as long as they don't go no. Finally. Has it moved? As long as they don't go like that. Stop it. Go away from me. I hate you. Stop. Away. He looked up here, and he didn't take a thing of it. To be fair, he didn't get a good peek. He just got a little peek. I don't remember what he looked like, so I don't know who to be scared of. So now I just have to be scared of everybody. Who? It's just you. Was it that dude? I can't remember if so he just stared at me. Oh. Who was it? Oh, God. It was him. He walked by me, like, two times. Perfect. Yeah, he walked by me multiple times. Please, I'm noob. Shiny. Give me shiny. 
Please, shiny. Oh, God. Don't do it, man. I'm trying to see if I could do it two times in the same server. Are people dumb filing cabinet in the bathroom? You know what? So I kind of fix the legs, but it also puts the thing above ground slightly. It's not good. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Literally, everybody just saw me. Everybody just saw me. My life is bad. Yeah, it's a little bit lopsided. Who cares, man? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Dude, I thought when she pulled out my mouth, I was like, I'm done. I'm dead. And she just walked past me while throwing it. All right, don't do the idol animation. Don't do the idle animation. Oh, my God. Oh, my god. Oh, my God, dude. Oh, God. I'm, like, slightly odd. My knife is sticking out slightly, too. Dude, this truly just looks like an innocent filing cabinet, though. Oh, God. She's putting in that work. She's, like, really trying to win, too. Not that people try to lose, but she's, like, kind of good. 
See, she's killing everyone. I am terrified of my character just doing the idle animation, just moving to the side while she's walking by me, and we might oh, dear. Wait, was that hurt? No. See how in the beginning of the round, you really have to just run away, like, in a jiffy? Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, my God. That's terrifying. I don't trust it anymore, but it seriously just looks like a filing cabinet. Dude, is that guy dead on the swing, or is that like a don't do it. Don't do the idol animation. Oh, my God, I'm a genius. Oh, my God. This one's so good, dude. All right. I think the only way she'll get me at this point is if oh, she says one v. One. Oh, no, there's somebody else in the server, too. There's somebody else in this no. Okay, so she's going to kill that person. Oh, that's, like, her boyfriend or something. She's, like, not killing them. She probably thinks he's, like, the last dude left. She's going to kill him. Oh, no, they're doing a one v one. Oh, I did it. 
I'm a genius. How do I keep doing it? Wonderful little girl. Yeah. Stop. Don't look at me. Don't look at me. I don't know if anybody saw that. Oh, my cover has been blown. I think she's suspecting me of not being a filing cabinet right in this very second. What the there's a box, mom. Booley booley. What do you mean? Bully? It's a cabinet. Yes. Oh, this isn't too bad. I have been put in worse situations. I'm basically hiding from them, not the murderer. All right. Yeah, that looks I wouldn't suspect me of doing anything bad. Okay. They're all going to see me as this, but then I'm going to switch it up on them. Yeah, get your laps in now, idiots. So next round, I'm going to switch into a crate. I'm hoping they don't notice. I switch. All right, I am now rock the people that originally downloaded an exploit to follow. There's a group of people who try to follow me using an exploit, and it works, but as you can see, they have no idea where I am now because I switched my character. 
This is all they see. Eoink. There you are. See, that's one of the dudes who followed me. They download hacks and then they use it to follow me into games. She has no idea. Well, I should have been a filing cabinet right here. That would have been perfect. All right, I am now a rock right here. Oh, God. I think she has killed that dude. Oh, yeah. There she is. Yes. I will follow her. Come to me. I have to be very, very careful. Oh, God, I just saw her. Oh, my God. Did she not see me? Did she really? She didn't see me. I really bumped into her, and she didn't see me. I'm actually in disbelief. The rock is perfect. Yeah, see you wish you could be me right now, huh? Wow, look at that. 
Incredible. I literally bumped into you. Basically, it threw off the hackers. It threw off her when I bumped into her. Incredible. Okay, see what I'm doing now? Boop. All right. Oh, God. I did too early. So see how I pretty much just reset? I was cletus. Oh, my God, this spot sucks. No, no, thank you. See, I was cletus, and then I reset in the lobby. See, I'm always super anxious in the lobby about, like, oh, my God, someone's gonna see me like this. Oh, my God, if I can just reset and, like, while it's loading the map, and it'll turn me into this. Oh, no. Oh, no. Brother, there's some drama in the in the chat right now. Victoria, denmark will be nuke tomorrow. Answer me. I'm having your kid. Everyone will report. Caden, he's a boy. He said he hit her. He's also saying Denmark will be nuke tomorrow. Look, if you don't like it, then leave. If you don't like the truth about Denmark, leave. Dude, bro, who's the murderer? If you dare send another text, I will end you. 
All right, I'm just hiding here now. Also, a big shout out to Tempers right now because he filled up a slot in the server so hackers can't join and expose me, because I've been trying for, like, an hour now. Well, like, a couple of hours total, and they keep ruining the surprise team. Yes. This guy's been waiting forever for someone to ask him that question. This guy is going to die so fast. That's probably the murderer, right? I hope. I love this little chat before aye, sheep who murder. He's on his grind right now. He's doing some investigative work, asking who the murderer is. Bold decision. He's probably going to come forward and say, hey, it was me. Sorry about it. I won't give away who I am, though. I know who I am. Stop moving. Okay. Thank you. Stop moving. Go away. Brought the stupid moving. Gave it away. I hate my life. Got me. Go. That's probably the murder right there. And you probably just ended both of us. Who's the murderer? 
Who was it, bro? I walked right by her. So that guy literally almost got me killed because that was the murderer. I'm having a heart attack right now. Yeah, guys. Oh, I'm a box. OOH, look at the box. I'm gonna turn into a bush in a second. Or a rock. You are all buffoons. Because I am a rock now. It's a normal box. I appreciate you, but actually, it's a rock. I innocent. I know. Murder. That guy has said that the past three rounds in a row, by the way. Oh, no. Oh, no. Was that up here? I'm too scared to come out. Oh, just a rock. Oh. Oh. Something bad is happening. Yeah, big rut row moment. See? It is just a rock, man. You didn't know. Hey. Put your hands up. Oh, God. I jumped down and he didn't know. 
Oh, my God, I missed again. No, please have mercy. Oh, my God. It bounced me back when I jumped. I don't care. I don't care. I jumped down. He did not. See? See me? I was still a rock the entire time. That's all that matters. But the rock bounced me back. It was my greatest friend, my most romantic relationship I've ever had, but my worst enemy. You guys want more of these videos? Tell Roblox to come out with a pure offline mode so hackers don't follow me everywhere I go and ruin my hiding spot. Then I'll do more of these.

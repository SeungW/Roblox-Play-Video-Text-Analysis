So today in Bloxburg, my boyfriend and I stayed at a super fancy hotel. After staying there for a while, we noticed that the owners seemed to know exactly what we were doing at all times. We weren't suspicious at first until I saw something or someone in the vent. Guys, be sure to watch until the end to see what happens. Hey, what is going on? You guys, I am back in Bloxburg today, and I am here with my super supportive boyfriend, baby. You're here because you want my crazy energy. No, it's because you want me for. I've been really sick and I've given up on the fact that I can have just a relaxed video because something crazy always happens and I need you here to support me. Oh, my God. You never just want to play Roblox with me. You only want me here for video. Man, you know what? I'm sick of this. I'm leaving. No, please feel good. I need you to be here for me. Fine. Fine. Okay. Just because you're sick. But what are we even doing today? 

You always have no game plan. I don't know. Oh, my God. Look at the chat box. New hotel is now open. Come check in. Said by hotel manager Jeff. He just said, we accept all people, all types. That's a new thing. Normally, it's really exclusive. Like boys only, rich only or something. He's on beach side. Okay. I can't really tell what side we're on because of all the look, this what? The mountain is literally on the other side, so I mean, I'll even let you drive. Oh, you're going to let me drive more? So, like, you want me to drive so that you don't have to. Really? Yes. All right, let's go. I think it's over there. The big pink building. The big pink this right here? Yeah. I think building. 

This does not look like okay, wait, I lied. Kitty nine, nine, seven, house. I lied. It's not the big pink building. Dude, this like this looks like Barbie Dreamhouse. I thought it looks like a hotel to me. This does not look like a hotel, okay? There's actually a lot of big builds over here. Wait, this is cookies are tasties. Wow. Cookies are definitely tasty. Wait, baby. Oh, this one has a big sign that says hotel. I bet it's this one. Okay. Oh, wait, babe. What? Get in the car. I thought we were just going to jump out. Babe, I'm really off of my game today. You really are off of your game. Okay, let's go ahead and just park the vehicle right now. What? I'm a Parker. You know what? Let's just knock on the door. Yeah, you lead, baby. Oh, wait. What the heck? I see him in there. Are you going to knock on I'm trying to. Do you not click on the doorknob? 

I am on the doorknob. Yeah. There we go. We knocked him sink. Yeah. Now we've been knocking on doors and hotel manager Jeff just said hello. Okay, I'm going to say hello. Yeah, I'll say hi. Okay. He looks pretty happy. He said, come in, come in. It's cold outside. He seems so nice. This place is literally so cute. Oh, dude, it's a bunch of, like, pastel bin elf on the shelf. I love this place. Christmas decorated. This is so cute. Why are there signs that say sigh? I don't know. He said, hello, welcome. I assume you saw my ad. Did he say yes, we did. Okay. This place is literally so cute. Yeah, this is literally like your ideal hotel scenario. Okay. It's got nice light colors and everything. Everything's, you know, cute. Looking at all yellow. Like, this is this is pretty good. Okay. He just said, great. This is a new hotel with just $500 a night. 
 
It's very nice and warm and we do everything we can to make sure you are comfortable. Would you both like to stay? It's a little expensive, but I'll say in the chat I'm going to say that's kind of pricey for a new hotel. Do you want to see? Maybe he'll drop the price. Maybe. I don't know, babe. Like, I'm not that good at negotiating. Wait. Oh, wait. He just said wait. Ha ha. I understand. Well, how about this? Let me give you a tour first, okay. And then you can decide. Okay. So we'll get to see the place first. I'm just going to say okay. It doesn't sound like he's going to give me a discount. That's fine. That's fine. Oh, another alpha on the shelf. This is so cute. He said this is our community hall. Okay. This is probably where they do breakfast and stuff. Yeah, this is really, really cute. He said a ton of tables and books. We also have a book club once a week. How nice. Baby, you love reading. 

I do. Maybe this is where they do breakfast because definitely for we have food here. Okay. This is cute. Okay. We have breakfast every morning. It's one of those, like, where you wake up early. Yeah, he just said all three. Okay. That makes up a little bit for the priceiness of the room. Yeah. I'm going to ask, is it good, though? Because babe, come on, $500 is like, pretty expensive. If you're paying $500, they should have pretty good food. He just said the food is amazing. Okay. Okay. So far so good. Yeah, I mean, I'm going to say I'm going to say is it still five? Wait, he said, we also custom make each dish for you. Wait, really? That is so cool. Baby, you know me. I know food. I love it. I just said awesome. Okay, you know what he said? Just tell us what you like and we'll make it work. Okay. We gotta stay here. 

Do you have sushi? Oh, my gosh. Babe, hold up. He said, of course. Oh, my gosh. Babe. I'll do it 500 if they can make me. I'm down. He just said, Would you like a room? Yes. I'll pay them. Okay. I like this place. I like the fancy places, babe. I know you. Babe. Do we get shown to our room? Yeah, he just said, great, follow me to your room. Okay. This is a cute hallway. I know, always elevator. Oh, my God. So nice. Yeah. So what floor are we going to? Oh, floor two. Okay. I guess. Okay. Up here. Those killer whales. Babe, I think those might be killer whales. I mean, whatever. Oh, yeah, they're nice. 

They're nice. It's okay. Okay, anyways, sitting right in front of room one. Oh, wait, so your room will be room two. I just got baited. Oh, my God. Okay, so this is our room and okay. I mean, pretty nice, but it's like it's kind of empty. Yeah, a little bit. Not a whole lot going on, but that's okay. He said, if you have any questions, please let me know. I'm going to say, can we get guested are you guessed it by any chance, babe? I think I am. Yeah. I'm not guessed it at all. Oh, he just said, of course you can. Okay, perfect. Yeah, I did pay the $500. He better have freaking guesses. I'm going to say I'm going to say. What is it? Like, thank you. Is that what you say? Okay, any questions, please let me know. The door. Do you want to look around, babe? Like, we got a nice view of you want to come over here? Trees. No trees and snow. 

The room is actually pretty cute. Yeah. Just following. Just like simple color, I guess. The bathroom. Yeah. Okay. I mean, not bad. Not bad. You got to walk in, shower and everything. That is pretty nice. Dark in here, though. I don't know. It's nice. I don't know if it's worth $500, but it's a pretty good place, I'd say. Yeah. We do have a huge TV, though, which is pretty cool. I don't really know what else we can do with TV. Do you want to lay in bed and watch TV? Yeah, I guess so. I'll just turn it on real quick. Okay. It looks like we got the news playing. Okay, stay updated on things. Yeah, I'll lay in bed and, like, sleep while we watch the news. Come on, now. What? Like, Dude, I'm turning off the TV. Babe, come on. This isn't enjoyable. I'm trying to make the best of a bad situation. Babe, I just made $500 for this. 

But you know, I was made it by the Sushi. Why didn't you warn me? Because I thought it was going to be cool. Everything else looked so nice. Okay, you know what? This okay, let's go downstairs and maybe see if there's some hotel activities. Yeah, I mean, I'm hoping that there's something else here. I'm sure there is. Okay, so let's see which way was the hotel again? I think it was this way by the whale painting. Oh, yeah, you're right. Okay. Are you calling the elevator? Right? Yeah. Okay, you know what? I think that this could be okay, we're going to find some activities to do. I don't think so, babe. I think this hotel is a scam, okay? I think it looks nice and all, but as from what I've seen from the rooms, it's not so good. All I'm saying is you have to talk to the dudes. Okay, fine. Fine. Oh, wait. He bay Why does it seem like he's, like, waiting for us? 

I don't well, I mean, nobody's here, I guess. Yeah. I'm going to say hi. Say hi. You didn't talk in okay, yeah, I'm going to say, so are there any hotel activities to help us? I misspelled all of it. He said, did you enjoy the news, Carrie? Any questions? I'm going to say sure. I did. Wait, what? How did you know? We watched the news from downstairs. We're only like okay, he just said, oh, yes, we do have activities, but they're all tomorrow. It is around like it's like 05:00 p.m.. So I mean, new people normally sleep around this time, he said, so please come back tomorrow. We'll have some fun stuff planned. Okay, you know what I'm going to say. 

Okay. I accidentally did that in all caps. Yeah. Okay. I guess let's just head back to our kind of a bummer. Yeah, it's fine. Okay, I'm not going to lie to you. I am a little paranoid because of I actually clicked go to floor three. I kind of messed up, I'm not going to lie. Wait, what's this? What is this? Okay, I don't know. A little weird. Okay. Under construction or something. I don't really know what that was. Okay, back to the floor two. Back to floor two. Anyways, as you were saying, I'm a little paranoid because I have been into some weird stuff when it comes to, like, staying in new places and everything. And now the easiest I'm here though, so it's okay. I'll protect you. Thank you. My big muscles. Why I needed you here. Yeah. Okay. I mean, it is getting pretty late outside. You can see it getting dark. So you want to snow a little bit, maybe? 

What do you want to eat tonight? I don't know. Thai food? Yeah, I guess thai food or something. Well, we had Thai food the other night. No, it's up. What? Wait, I just saw feet in the vent. Wait, hold up. Wait, what? Where are you recording? Yeah, I just pushed record a second ago. Wait, did you catch it on like, film? Yeah, they were just like little feet. Where? What the heck? In the vent? Right above the bed. Wait, I don't know if you can hear that. Wait, babe, I don't know if you have your sounds on. I do. Wait, I think I hear something. Wait, hold on. What the heck? Wait, is somebody looking at us? I don't think so. This seems like just, like, a normal vent system. Wait, are you sure you saw, like, feet or whatever? 

Okay, yo, don't shoot the messenger. Okay, look, I'm just freaked out. What the heck? What was that? I don't know. I didn't even see it. Do you want to go look at the vent or something? Yeah, let's try to look around or something. Okay, that's fine. I had already opened it, but fine. Okay. How do you suppose we get to the vents? You've already been to floor three, and there was nothing up there anyways. So you think there's a way? Maybe there's, like a janitor's closet right here, maybe just clean vents? Yeah, I think so. They got to get, like, the dust out and stuff. Oh, I grabbed a flashlight. Wait, there's literally a ladder to the vents. Okay, should I keep the flashlight? Yeah, there's actually another one right here. Let me go ahead and grab one, too. Are we really about to go into events? Yes. Oh, dang it. 

Oh, my God. Babe, can you literally not get up here? Babe. Okay. Climb, Carrie. I'm trying. I'm just really freaked out. Get up onto the jump. Jump, jump. I did it. I did it. Okay, wait. We're literally in the vent right now. What the heck? It looks like baby, it looks like it goes into two paths. Do you want to, like, split up for this or something? We both have flashlights. Okay, let's go together. Let's go together. Are you sure? I've kind of freaked out. Okay, that's fine. That's fine. Okay, we'll go ahead and go together. Okay. Be slow. Okay? I don't want to fall through. What the heck? Wait, babe, wait. What the heck? Wait, look down. Wait, babe, this is like, a bathroom. Wait, what? How did you just, like, see into people's rooms? Yeah. Shouldn't this be, like, closed off better or something? Okay, that's not cool. Okay, let's go ahead and wait, is that wait, that's our bet. 

That's our bet. No, this is where somebody was. Are you sure? Yes. Okay. I literally saw feet right there. Oh, my gosh. What the heck? Okay, do you want to keep going or something? If someone was up here, chances are they're probably long gone by now, aren't they? I mean, maybe should we just keep going? Wait. Follow me. I swear I heard something. Hold on, hold on. Let's go fast. I swear I hear something. Terry. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Wait. What the heck? Hotel management judge just said oh. What is this? Wait, what the heck? What are you doing here? Literally, what the heck? He said this is what. Wait, what does that mean? He just said okay, you caught me. Doing what? I'm just going to throw a bunch of question marks. Literally, what have you been doing? Why is this dude in events. 

He just said wait. Oh, that was you. That was you. That was you. Okay. What the what the heck? I like to watch people when they sleep. He said, this is what I've made. What the heck I'm going to say? That's so messed up. Creepy much? Okay, babe, not going to lie. Wait, you just said but I'll never get caught. Wait, how do you do that? I can't fit. How did he wait. Oh, my God. Wait. He's going to get away. I can't get down. I literally can't. Babe, babe, you have to go get it. Wait, go. He's already gone. I mean, he's still on the server, but, like, babe, he could be in any of these rooms. And chances are he might actually be able to trap us in any of these rooms. Do you want to just, like, leave or something? You know what? I want to get out of here. That game that creeped me out so much. You know what? I'm just going to leave the game. 
 
Yeah. Yeah, I'm leaving too. That was something else. What the heck? What the heck? No more hotels and no more videos with Carrie. No.

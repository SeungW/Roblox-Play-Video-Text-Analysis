So I always wanted to own a five star restaurant with a bunch of rich people, but I never had the money. But today, I'm gonna fulfill my dream, because we can buy the royal table for 120 Robucks. I literally bought 160 Robucks, so we can do, like, the whole thing. Now, if you guys don't know what a VIP customer is, it's this dude. All right? Look how rich he is. Don't you want something like this in your restaurant? Of course you do. All right. He gives you the most money. We're gonna buy a Ferrari. We're gonna get all kinds of stuff. How many are we gonna buy? We have ten tables, which is how many chairs do we need? Count 40 chairs. All right. All right. We got 45 royal chairs. A YouTube customer. Just enter your restaurant. Oh, my God. YouTube star. Hey, it's me. It's me. I'm a YouTuber as well. You don't care. Okay. Oh, no. This place is going to have to look a little different. Guys, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. I don't want to kick you out, but we need to make space. There's going to be a lot of changes around here. How do we do this? Wait, do I just make, like, two rows? I don't know. This is okay. All right, so we got the table. This is so bad. Place those chairs down, baby. Oh, I could feel it feeling my fingers. I could feel in my bones. I'm becoming rich. There's nothing you can do about it. 
Haters. I don't even have chairs. I need to buy more. Oh, my God. Another VIP customer. Another one? Yeah, don't mind me. I'm just buying a bunch of stuff for Robucks. Dude, I always get to a point that doesn't even let me allow to get more because I just spend too much. Hey, where's everyone? Where is this place? Not fool. This is impossible. Wow, this is so much. All right, well, I think I'll need a boost. Now, this is the fun part, because we're going to start seeing a lot of customers here. All right, I'm just going to keep accepting them. Moment we've been waiting for. Oh, my God. Yes. Welcome, welcome. Please have a seat. Dude, I want to have I got to fill the whole thing up. We're going to fill the whole thing up. Oh, yes. Four more. Welcome. Today is a party. A YouTuber. I don't care. Are you a VIP customer? I guess not. Oh, my God. Dude, there's no one here. Whoo. All right, well, wait, it's going to get filled up, dude, don't worry. Don't worry. I promise I won't let you down. I think we just need to click a little more. The problem is we got to fill up all the seats, because it's not going to generate every single VIP customer. But I want to fill the whole thing up. Oh, another one. Look at that. Yes. More. Oh, this is so cool. Where you see them? Oh, my God. Look at that. 
Look how many wow. They're all going to be rich and they're all going to be successful. Yes. Come on, more. They just keep going. They just keep going and going. Oh, my God, even it's so satisfying to see this many, like, VIP customers here. Okay, okay. It's getting filled up. It is getting filled up, dude. All right, I'm just going to leave this on for a minute. We got to fill the place up. Oh, my God. This is the moment. You and me and everyone here, we're waiting for. Serpents your lude. Come on, chop, chop, chop. These are VIP customers, dude, and this is very important for us. This is a very important meeting. All right, I want to thank everyone for coming. Thank you for spending so much money on this horrible food. I mean, it's good. It's good. Don't worry. We don't spit in our food. No. Make sure it's high quality. Dude, I can't believe the whole thing is filled up. It's so satisfying. There's one more thing I could do, and that's, like, move this and put more tables here. But I don't think that would look good. I think this is, like, the best. And we did fill up the whole room. It is, like, completely ridiculous, and I just want to make it look at least a bit normal. I know it's not normal. 
It's horrible. So I'm happy that we redone this floor, but there's more to be done. All right, so this floor is pretty nice. I love this floor. For anyone that doesn't remember, we did, like, a sky lounge here. And the 10th floor, that's the VIP gaming room for gamers. If you're a gamer, you come over here, look at that. See? YouTube celebrity. YouTube celebrity. Another YouTuber. Yeah, he's irrelevant. He's only, like, 5 million subscribers. I don't even know what these guys are, but they're making money, and that's important to us. My restaurant money comes first, and then my happiness, then my Lambo, and then whatever comes next. I don't know. Customer satisfaction, I don't care. But this baby, this puts a smile on my face. This puts a smile on my pocket. And that's all I need, a big old smile on my very, very deep pocket and wallet. All right, dude, I am thinking of removing this. But it's a nice place. I don't want to remove it. Wait, let me see what else they've added. I know that there's, like, a bunch of stuff that they did and wait a minute. 
Oh, yeah, look. They've added an arcade machine, a soda machine. Now, I bought those. I think I have both of them. They've even did a money hedge. I don't know what this is. Let's buy one of them. It's pretty expensive. 600 Robusts. Oh, my God. More celebrities. Can you believe it? Dude? I'm actually I'm just going to remove this. I'm sorry. I'm kicking you guys out, but you're, like, irrelevant. You're not spending enough money here. And this is a gaming room. And from now on, we're gonna get a we're gonna put a candy machine here, a salad bar for any salad lovers there, but you'll still stay fat. Salad doesn't work for you, buddy. Now, a soda machine for anyone that wants to spend more money. Golden tip jar. Oh, yeah. All right, just for anyone that wants to put a little bit more onto our pocket. Yes, the arcade machine. I think we got another one, right? Yes. The slot machine or money hedge. Okay, there it is. Okay, let's see. $600. Dude, that is bad. It is horrible. All right, so I didn't get the I don't think I got the arcade machine. Or did I did I get the arcade machine or no, we don't have the paintball edition. 
Oh, my God. So many VIP customers, dude. Okay, wait, we need one more. Where is it? There it is. All right, delete this. Don't gamble, kids. Hey, do you want to spin? No, I don't care. And there we go. We got two arcades. We got a wishing well. You never know when you wish comes true. A salad bar. This is, like, a little personal space area for anyone that wants it. And there is the holy grail diamond play button, and it's beautiful. I love it. And, yeah, I think this is basically it. I guess this is, like, for more money, and this is for people to get high scores on. And the salad bar, well, I never seen anyone use it. I think it's useless. Like, no one goes to the salad bar, but it's there, so you can use it. Oh, wow. Yes. All right, let me take your order, sir. Let me take your order. Anyone else? I'm sorry, I don't want to step on the table. I apologize. All right, dude. Well, we did get nine nine customers. I don't know what else we could do here. This was the update. I hope they add more stuff. Like, this is nice, but you could get a little bit more. The gamer set is still on, but I'm not going to buy it. It's too expensive. 
Oh, and there's another theme, the modern theme, and we already used that one. No one cares. All right, so this place is empty again. Oh, man, what am I going to do? I thought since I got 2 billion, which is a lot of money I know. You know what we could do? We could probably do these VIP as well, but they don't look. Oh, my God. Hello. No, we're going to have a look. If we can buy anything else, I'm going to have to put the pyramid somewhere. 13 million customers surf. Dude, this guy doesn't have a life. So there's a bunch of decoration we can get, including the penthouse rope, which is 900. All right, some items are really expensive. I really want to get the luxury sign. So we're going to get one because why not? 200 million? I don't know. Doesn't leave a scratch. All right, welcome will come. Those areas are pretty much finished. I don't know if we could put anything else here. I need to place a pyramid somewhere. All right, that's the next thing we're going to do because we lost the pyramid officially. All right. Yeah. I know where we're going to put the sign. Oh, there it is. All right here. Yes, this is exactly what you need. You know what? You're going to put it somewhere else. Yes. Welcome, rich people. Please have a seat and enjoy your lunch. 
They're very expensive lunch. Why is it expensive? Oh, because you're rich. It's not special. In fact, it's pretty normal. All right, so the slot machines could be here somewhere. I just want to delete like, I'm probably just going to remove all of this because I don't know where else to put this. We're just going to put it on a jewelry case over here. This looks good. All right, where should we put the pyramid? Oh, I know. I know where to put the pyramid. We got the spot. This is so big. It's so useless. Like, how big can this be to call him in? Oh, man, it is shaking. The whole thing is shaking. All right, these tables are going to be a little smaller. I feel like it doesn't fit here anymore. There we go. Okay, this looks a lot better now. Much cleaner. The fountain is very okay, wait, I want to see what we got. All right. Welcome. Please join my restaurant. It doesn't matter if you're a devil. You're a rich guy. We accept everyone because everyone has money. Oh, yes. This is my favorite part. Where is he? There he is. Welcome. Please have a seat. Where is he going to go? 
Dude, don't tell me you're going to sit here between the plebs. You have so many options. Dude, don't tell me you're going to be over here. You can be in between to reach people. Yes. Go. All right. Where is he going to go? 10th floor. Come on, dude. I got to find him. All right. He's not into Hawaii place. Oh, yes. You're over here and it's your pyramid. Well, that makes perfect sense. All right, I'll take your orders. Thank you very much. I got to take care of my customers. You never know when you have customers like this. Get to work. Get to work now. Oh, my God. Okay, wait, I got some food. Where do I put this? There's a little present inside. Just kidding. You're single. My God, dude, so many celebrities here. Yeah. Join me. So I guess this place is finished. I honestly don't know what else to do. I've covered up the whole update. One last thing. I haven't not taken a gamble yet. And don't gamble, kids, but we are going to gamble. All right, let's go. Come on. You got some high scores over here. Come on, let's see what we get. No, we didn't get anything. All right, but thanks a lot for watching. If you guys enjoyed this or you want to see more, don't forget to leave a like like. Don't forget to subscribe down below for more.

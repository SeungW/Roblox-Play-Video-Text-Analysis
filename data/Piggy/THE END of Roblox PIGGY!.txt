Hey, everyone, it's your friend at Think noodles. And welcome back to Roblox Piggy, possibly for the very last time. Now don't dislike the video that says nothing against piggy or midi tune or the game or anything. It's just a fact about piggy. It has is updated with a brand new skin with the winter season. And with this new update, minitune has tweeted. Ahoy, everyone, the next piggy season will be the last piggy season and last update to the main game to exceptions being build mode and buzzing. Spent a lot of fun working on the game over the met over the years. I couldn't be happier to have met many of you through it. While the journey has been fantastic, I've gotten very burnt out of working on this game and wanted to work on new products for a long time. And it's hard to continue updating a game that just doesn't resonate with you anymore. 

And yes, it is sad. Cry it out. Let's cry it out together, guys. But this is the final content update for piggy, the final skin, obviously, besides build mode and bug fixes, I don't play a lot of build mode, as you guys already know. So this might actually be my final piggy video. And what a riot it has been over the last two and a half years. When I made my first piggy video, we were just hitting the COVID-19 pandemic and, well, it's still kind of here, but we're in a better place than we were way back then. Now, I'm not saying this is my final video because you never know, maybe someone will make a build on a map that makes piggy relevant, like, I don't know, like a doors map. And I might play piggy, but it's doors or something like that. So I will never rule it out. This game is still pretty much my favorite game on Roblox and I think it always will be. 
 
So let's have a look at the season. This is my homage to minitoon, where I end up paying him a bunch of Robucks for spitting the daily quests, because I like to do the entire season in one video. So strap in, guys, it's going to be expensive. So let's see what we've got. Build mode, event build. As always, we're going to get that final journal entry, which I wonder what that's even going to say. And what is this skid? What is the I don't know what that is. All I know is it's got six legs. It's got something weird hanging out in the back. All right, let's start with our quest. We need to get our we need to get our presence. So we got to play infection mode at the end, we got to skip a chapter and we got to infect three players on infection mode. Mini, so why you starting like this? 

Because, like, actually, now that I think about it, it is faster to just go straight into a pub lobby, especially with infection mode, because you get infected first and you can infect people quickly. Look. And somebody's already asking for an infection. Dug. Dug. A pull is up. A liza plays a place. Oh, right, guys, it's not the right one, but the sentiment is there. If you're ever buying a roadblocks or premium, don't use star coded noodles. Unless you want Roblox to literally pay me money every time you use it, because if you do, that's what they got to do. So if I'm buying a bunch of piggy points from minitoon here, you stay away. This is my infection, dude. Don't you get near my I'm getting infected first. No. There we go. Hey, no, I come on. To get you. Here we go, buddy. Bam. Thank you. That's one. Cho ching. Here we go. Bacon. Baker, baker bacon. That's two. 

Let's go. Come on, let's get three. All in one round, please. Ain't everybody oh, that went too fast. You guys, I needed to get it's a Peggy party. Okay. Did I? Yes. See? But I didn't. All right, now, it's a ton of galleries since yes, I know this is the fastest way you can get XP and escape a map. Yes. It's even faster than Carnival. There it is. Bam. Let's go. That's on. We're out. Let's go. Look at that. Yeah. A little over two minutes, but we get all of that XP. Look at that. We're already level two. Almost level three. Let's roll, baby. Here we go. Yeah. Actually, how many piggy points do I have? I haven't looked. So okay, trader mode, get five kills. Swarm I could do, but mini tune, bro, you're making me play pup matches like, this is usually a private server event for me. 

I'm going to be jumping back and forth quite a bit. Hacker. Oh, we might relive an old video here. Come on, come on, come on. Get them, get them. Big fan noodles. Did you get it? You get it. Come on. Is it me? Is it me? Yeah. Let's go. Sorry, going to have to kill you. All right, let's see. Mr. Stitchy and I switched up the skin. I kind of want to switch it up for every time I end up being piggy because, like, I mean, we might as well showcase the skins over the last good 

news. Goodness knows how many updates we've had on the game, starting with this guy goo. Okay, there we go. There we go. There we are. No, I can't get you there. Okay? I know I can't get you there, but can I get you here? Nobody there. All right. Oh, jeez. Well, I just got somebody. I didn't even see you. And I got you. All right, now, I just needed oh, yeah. Let me just put a trappy. Trap, like, right about right about there. Okay, enjoy that. Okay, come here. Come here. No, you don't. Come here. Come here, buddy. Oh, man. Mr. Stitch. You can't make it through there. I don't know, Kenny. Kenny not really sure. Come on, Mr. Stitchy. Come on. All right. It's very, very bright. I forgot how bright it is in the winter. Come on. That's two. 

Yo, it's a hacker. Yo, you guys, what am I going to okay, okay. What do we got? Okay. All right. What are we going to do? What are we going to do? What are we going to do? How are we going do this? All right, we're going to leave her. We're going to leave her because we obviously know up. There you're go. Got her? Let's go. All right, let's do it. Okay, that's two. Why is my trap in such a weird spot? It's like floating it's over to this oh, no. I guess it's in the right spot. Okay, where is that person? Are they on top of the house? Let's see. I hear a bunch of footsteps, but I don't see any peoples. Let's see if we can find some peoples. Okay. They ain't done nothing. There. Jumper down. Okay, where is everybody? Y'all around here? Y'all ain't doing nothing. Oh, wait, wait. Oh, I thought I saw somebody. Hello? All right, so I'm thinking maybe, but I doubt it. My vent monster can get her, so I was waiting for the trap to go. All right, where's she at? Where'd she get oh, dude. Okay, she's outside the window there. All right, let's see what we can do with this vent monster. 

Do your thing. Drag down the hacker. Guys, I might be a noob. I don't know if I can catch this hacker. All right, who else we got? Is there anybody else? There should be at least one more there. Hello. Come on, come on. Okay, if you're going to go down okay. All right, go ahead, go ahead. But there's going to be a problem when you do this. Okay. You see, you're going to ouch, right? Yeah, see, that's a problem, right? And then I come around here, and then I get you. Okay. Oh, jeez. I thought that was the hacker because she was in the air. But how do I get to the hacker? Dude, I was thinking snowball, but snowball isn't going to bring her down. Oh, there's my vent monster. Hey, can you, like, do something, man? Like, are you stuck in the snow or something? Because you couldn't even get the other person. All right, let's see. Let's do this. Let's see it hit her. Well, let me climb on top of the house. Come over here, vent monster. Come here. Let me see if I could use you. I can't jump on him. I was thinking, oh, wait, can I? Come here, buddy. Come here. 

See if I was I can't jump up there. This one's a tough one because she is not actually trying to solve the map. She's just trying to hide. This is terrible. I tell y'all, this is terrible. Let's do this. Let's at least get some snowballs hitting her. No, she's out of snowball range. What kind of snowmen are you, huh? Setting up an army here. I made my fifth kill. You think you're so cool. Yeah. All right, we're getting somewhere now. No, we're not. I wish I could hit her. Imagine like, I get her through the roof, like hit her with my head. Look at this position. What is this? Oh, my goodness, look at this position. Yeah, I win. I win. Hey, that keeps my streak alive. Unfortunately, though, I guess I'm a noob. So we got four kills. 

What are we going to do? Swarm and traitor. All right, we're going to do all of this on a private server now. All right, there we go. On to already level four. I like it. Yeah, let's spend some more coins. Tag mode to the end. Escape a chapter. So technically that would work. And then infection mode anytime. Stop it. This is so stupid because it's going to start costing me so much, but I don't actually care. I'm going to go ahead and skip some of these infection mode at the end, which is okay. Five kills again and swarm mode again. I'm just getting these presents is going to be murder. I mean, I want both of these skins to the alternate Skin and the Skin. I need them both. I have to have all my skins, have to have all the skins in piggy or else what kind of piggy YouTuber am I? I'd be a complete failure if I don't unlock these skins. So I got to get the presents, but I also want to get the XP. 

Please, please, please, please. Yes. Finally. Holy cow, guys, I have been extremely unlucky, okay? I wasn't even sure what map this was, but I've probably gone through twelve rounds trying to be biggie and I finally got it and I don't like that poly. Now this is one of the OG not available secret quest skins from the I guess it was the jailbreak collaboration, right? It was in Mall, the quest to get the pole skin can't get it anymore, but he's one of the OG secret quest skins and I thought I'd bring him out. I tried to get Mall on every round that I tried, but it didn't work out. So now playing house, where is everybody? 

Usually you get people in the middle here, but I guess not today. All right, that's okay, that's okay. We'll go ahead and drop one of these babies right there because that's where people like to land. Wait, did y'all not come out of there yet? What? You know, pulley's music is pretty loud, bro. Where is everyone? Seriously, like, are there okay, I had to check and see. Oh, there's one. There's one. Oh, no, you don't. Oh, you only got one. Let's go. I don't know where that hammer is now, but I know he didn't get that second one, which is good. Where did he get the hammer from? Okay, I see the wrench there. Oh, you went all the way down here already, bro. You did. Oh, it's Santa. Oh, wait. Are you Santa? You got a Santa hat on, but you blow santa, is this this is Papa Smurf? No. Santa Smurf. Is there a Santa Smurf? Come here, buddy. All right, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna go ahead and do this, all right? And we're gonna drop that, like, right over there. Okay? Now I'm gonna chase you and you get stuck. Here we go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. 

Let's go, Santa. Let's go, Santa. Let's go, by. All right, that's two. All right, we need to get three more kills. Hopefully there's no hacker in this. We can get a full five. All right, I might have to get my crawling trap out because nobody's got anybody. Yeah, nobody's gotten red. This is weird. This is very, very weird. It's kind of a mystery. Are they in the backyard? You all making snowballs, just throwing me back here. What are you doing? Whoa, guys, guys. I just want to kill you. All right? Go do your thing. Go find something. Don't flip over. Go do something. Hey, come on, man. Why are you so glitchy? All right, here we go. Here we go. Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going? All right. Oh, they was hiding back there. See, I didn't know that. Thank you. Thank you. He was hiding back there. I see you. My crawling trap is coming for you, dude. Okay, so he's going to go up, he's going to hit my trap on the way down. I think you should let's see. 

Yep, he did. Oh, did oh, I might not make it. Okay. Yeah, I did. Yeah, I did. Oh, I got no, no. It's because I clipped that edge, dude. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Crawl, crawling chap, crawl. Sir, I don't appreciate you getting stuck. Oh, he went down. But the crawling chap yo, where are you doing? Crawling chap. Crawling chap. Kit, why are you stuck, bro? You're supposed to be crawling. You're not actually doing your job. Do your job. Oh, noob. That noob. Literally is Davis. Noob. Okay. My crawling chap has alerted me to your presence, sir. And now you are between us. Yeah. Get them. Let's go. We got them. Bam. I know the moves. No, no. Hey. I only got four kills. Oh, that's frustrating. Okay, well, private serve. I'll kill my wife. There she is. 

We got frost. Higging. Yeah. Now, even though I'm just, like, going after my wife, I thought I'd show this one off as well. This was from a winter event. I'm trying to remember if it was the first one or if that was Rained desk. I think that she was the first winter event. I could be wrong. I know you all are going to correct me in the comments if I am. All right. So loud. All right, let's see what the next set of events are now that we've got that full. We've got 525 playhouse, escape a chapter escape a chapter on Infection mode. I like this one. We can do this all in one round. Escape infection with at least five minutes left. I was going to say I want to go hit up yeah, I like this. I'm going to go hit up gallery for a quick few completions for XP. Oh, dude. Under five. Let's not talk to myself here. 

Let's talk about under two minutes. Let's go. Bam. All right, so that actually unlocks that entire string and we get some XP out of it. Come on. Yeah. All right, let's go to the next one. I like what Mini Tune is doing here. Swarm five kills. Infection doesn't. Three completely separate modes, and I hate it. Oh, right. I have not man, that is embarrassing to see. I almost don't want to show it in the video, but that's very embarrassing that I haven't unlocked a new player ability. We're going to check that out in a second now that I've gone and unlocked it. So yeah, finally unlock the new player ability scanner. I think it is. I don't actually know what it is. So that's a survivor ability as we know. Where is it? Track all nearby infected for 3 seconds. 

That would mean you could track Piggy, right? Even if it's not infection mode. Right. Pretty useful. Actually, it's only four. I mean, I love sprint. I don't use decoy very much at all. You know what? I'm going to go ahead and equip this new one. Well, I'm going to buy it, obviously, and I'm going to equip it. Yeah. So now we got a four, a six, and a seven I use invisibility a ton. So let's see if how this thing works here. Let's see. Bunk. Yeah, there it is. Okay, but it's really quick. I mean, it doesn't cost a lot of what is that? What do you call this? Energy? Yeah, it's energy. So it is okay that it doesn't last very long. It just gives you an idea of where Piggy actually is. So you don't have to worry. Maybe don't have to worry about her or you do. All right, there we go. 

Level up. Level ten, which means, yeah, I do have the coins. Alternate skid a buddy. It's a frost piggy bunny. I love buddy. Okay, I still don't know what this is, but I only have 75 gifts, and like, I'm already almost completed. We got it. We got to do some of this. And I might do some extra skips. Let's see what's the best yeah, I want to do infection mode because a lot of people are playing infection mode, but what we got to do is go check out our skin. Where are you, Bunny? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? There she is. Bunny. Alternate frost bunny. There we go. Yeah. All right. Okay. Yeah. No, wait. I didn't change it. Just regular frost diggy. Oh, no, wait. Yes, I did, did I not? I must have tagged over to it, but never actually selected her. That's mine. Don't you touch him. 

Bam. That's two. All right. Yo, why are you so fast, dude? How you out? How's that guy so much faster than me? I'm going the other way. Oh, no, that's mine. Funny. Alternate equip. I did not click equip. Okay. Yeah. There we go. All right, we can get five kills here. Yeah, I think it is cool. This is better than playing an infection mode because we can actually hear the music and everything. There we go. Oh, look at Bunny. We get a really good look at her. So half of her face, but not her body. Half of her face is frozen. She's got wings of ice and she's got her crossbow. I don't know what her kill is going to be like, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be like an ice pick to the face. This is an angry looking bunny, isn't she? All right, let's do this. 

Gosh, I haven't played maul in so very long. Oh, man, her music is so sad. Whoa. Wait. Hot on his head. Okay, there's the first one. Oh, I didn't even see it. I wasn't looking. Oh, wait, there's me. That's like an imposter me. Got him. Yeah, she definitely shoots an arrow. There's another one. He just stood there for it. I don't know what that was about. All right, let's see. Here we go. I'm not going to bother swarm, but I'm going to give him my coins here. All right, so we've got, what, 200? What? I gotta get a thousand, bro. I'm gonna get to level ten, but okay, tag mode to the end. Ten items. Swarm mode. Bruh. Okay. All right. That's two rounds. Okay, bro. Oh, what happened? Is he picking his nose? Dude, he got stuck. 

All right, well, it kind of sucks because it's on swar mode. Well, he may not get unstuck, but the next bot will be unstuck. Is he still there? Oh, yeah. I could use this. Like, let's see. Yeah, dude, he's still there. All the way back. That's amazing. Oh, that will actually be useful on swarm mode because you can see where all of the bots are. All right, let's see it now, because this is going to be kind of cool. Let's see. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Look at that. That is cool because I can see where torture was moving, which direction he was going. That's cool. And it worked by Ellie. See ya. Bam. All right, that unlocks the whole chain, I think. The chains. There we go, baby. All right. Oh, and we've almost actually were about we're close to level eleven here. Okay. Buy new quests. Way low on gifts. Infection, ten items, five minutes left. That's one. Single infection, ten items, five minutes left. 

Yeah. All right, I like it, I like it. It's going well now. All right, there we go. Cha ching, cha ching, cha ching. Two. Come on, keep oh, we got yeah. All right, we got it all. So misery. What is it? It's got six legs, so it could be an ant with a big butt or maybe it's pregnant or something. I don't I don't I don't know, man. Oh, I don't I don't know if I'm scared of it now. All right, let's do this. Okay. Infection, five kills. Swarm. Okay, I guess I'll do. Swarm. And then I'm just going to start spending money to get ones that I want. So we can just get this as quickly as possible because we got all the XP we need. Why can't I view the journal entry? Brah, that took longer. Swarm, man, I'm telling you, not the easiest is definitely the hardest. 

Game mode. Okay, so can I view it now? Why can't I view the journal entry? That's frustrating. I might have to, like, like, reload the server. It doesn't think I unlocked it. Five kills. Two matches to the ow. At least this one's. Okay, five minutes left. That would be oh, but then five kills. I would have to go to a pub server, but I want to get my before I do. This is taking ages. Hot diggity. No, look at that. That might be a record for me. 1 minute, 45 seconds. Yeah, I think that was a record, actually. If I go play, what is the best way to do this? You know what? We're going to give minitune some more event. I can't even buy quests. Ah, it worked. Okay, now I can't press buy a new quest button because I'm out of piggy points. 

Aren't I fun? Some call him the ranger. Others call him the lonesome wayfarer. He just appears and vanishes. Vanishes just like a whistle in the wind. Whistling winter. He's been spotted everywhere from around the lab to the southern desert. Apparently. Rumor has it that he's saved a couple of travelers too. They say he's looking for someone or something. Or maybe someone. As long as they're not looking for me, I'm all right with not knowing. I've got the whole military doing that already. Kane clip. Are they talking about me? Lonesome warfare. The ranger. That sound like me? So it looks like I need to buy a bigger boy. Mini tune. Thank you. Thank you for making this game. And I I give you my Robucks as. Thanks. Let's just let's let's pay mini tune. Five minutes left. Five kills. Trader mode. I could do that one again. 

What are we at? 650? That's gonna bring to 750. All right, that should do it. Yep. Okay. Oh, boy. In fact, three players play to I hate this one. You know what? That's it. What? Play lab. You literally just have to play it infect three no. Okay. Escape. There Escape infection mode. Use ten items, play two matches that I could I am leasing a ton of Robucks, but hey, again, this is, again, maybe my final piggy video. I don't mind putting an extra couple of dollars into Mini Tooth pocket for all he's given us over the years with this game. And plus, you guys are going to use star code noodles, right? So that when I run out of Robucks, roblox would give me some more for you all using that right, right now, 

that's a record right there. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Yeah. 1 minute 40. Let's go. All right, what do we got? Yeah, look at that. Look at that. All right, so let's see. Come on, give me something good. No, no, no. Oh, no. I'm out. Gee, too bad. I guess I'll buy some more. Okay, wait, I can only buy two more, and then I'm out of Roebucks. Hopefully, I don't need to buy two more sets. Bam. Escape. Wait. Okay. Escape a chapter wait, what do we need? We need 100 and Escape a chapter on swarm mode. All right, that's what it is, then. All right, there we go. Papa. Give me my one. My what is that, 100? I think it'll just it'll just put us over to 1025, I think. Yeah, I can do math. 

All right, let's buy a Misery and let's check this out. So it is complete, first of all. So I have all of the skins and alternate skins for all the chapters, all the extras. My collection is complete. It feels really, really good. Let's check out Misery. Let's get on a pub server, and let's kill some noobs. Me, me, me. Yeah. Let's go, let's go, let's go. All right, let's see the final skin. This is the final skin ever added. Biggie. I'm a little nervous. Oh, and we're going with Skull. Oh, my. Yes. Oh, look, he's got, like, a trail of snow that he leaves behind him. So what is this on the back? 

It's a white, so I thought the green I didn't realize that was the beard. Green are the feet and the beard. He's actually white. He's got eyelashes. I mean, Santa Claus, but he's got a I don't know, a mushroom Daglo or something. I don't know what's going on there, but, man, I have not played school in so long. I remember, guys, this was the first map I ever did, the first one I ever completed the ten bots challenge on. Okay, that's really weird, dude. Just creeping me out a little bit. Hold on. They're whispering. Crawl and chat tell me where they be show me the way okay, she's going that way. You go that way. I'll catch around this time. Oh, no, it's going to get her first, I think. Or is it? Okay. Got one of them. Okay, it's dragging her to me. Thank you. There we go. 

We got one. What? No. Holy what? You stupid trap. You were supposed to give her to me. Oh. Got one. Finally. That's the one. That buddy. Buddy. How could you? I got the frost bunny. Oh. I'm kissing buddy. They're my trap. No trap. You were too early. Buddy, no. This is stupid. It's chaos. Look, everybody's looking at me. They're laughing. They're probably voice chatting together, making fun of me. Aren't they? Aren't you? Come on. What? How did I ran right through her. What was that bra. I don't understand. Right through her. Get her. Thank you. All right, there's one. All right, come on. Now this is getting ridiculous. Oh, no, you don't. You can't feed the bunny. The bunny is where I am. You can't feed the bunny. No. Nice piggy backpack. 

Sorry. Goodbye. Come on. There. Finally. All right. Yes. Okay. I don't know how she went through me last time. You got to go grab that guy. Fine, let's grab him because he's just hanging out down here. Got him. Woof. I didn't really want that, though. Come on. Go, go, go, go. No, no. Yes. Like 1 second left. All right, close enough. GG. All right, guys. I didn't kill everyone. Though I did kill, like, five people. But not everyone. Because someone rejoined. Anyway, that's it for the final pitch update. And we got all this skinned.

CookieSwirl. See? Hello, Cookie fans. Today I am going to be a police officer in Roblox. OOH, we could take the big Roblox police bus out. Wait a minute. That means I'm going to be transporting prisoners. I don't know if I exactly want to do that today. Back here to the station and park. OOH, maybe we can take the police cruiser out. Go ahead and get my police car. There we go. Are these police? Police car is working. No, I can't get my police car to work. All right, we'll just take the police bus. I can barely see from inside of here. Dunkin Donuts. There's Dunkin Donuts. I have to go to Dunkin'Donuts. Good thing I don't have any prisoners in here, or else I wouldn't be able to go and go into Dunkin. Donna. Yes, we're here. OOH, sweet. Can I get one strasberry filled donut, please? Officer Cookie. Officer Cookie. And we need you. Oh, we can teleport to the police station. There we go. I'm at the police station. Hello? Did you guys call for me? Wait a minute. I got to get my police outfit on. Oh, yeah. Officer Cookie. 
There we go. Teleport back to the police station. Officer Cookie. Officer Cookie. She's here to help. There's nobody in the offices. Let me see if I can see what's going on on the computer. Looks like it's going to be a busy day today on the police force. Well, nobody's in jail. Maybe that means I need to go out and start catching some bad guys. Let me see. Is there a call? Officer Cookies. Officer Cookie, we need you. We need you. Requesting backup. Okay, I'm on my way. Run, run, run, run, run, run. Where's my police car at? Hey, wait. What happened to my police officer outfit while the cars are crashing? What? This car totally flipped up. Whoa, they're moving. Careful, careful, careful. Hey, look at that tow truck. It looks like it's towing a police car. All right, we'll spawn a car. Hop in. Oh, there's a police right there. No, my car will move. I can't get my car to go. No. What is going on? I need to go help these officers out. No, don't hit me. Don't hit me. Don't hit me. No. She almost hit me. 
All the police are chasing her. No, the police car tips over. Okay, she pulled over. He's requesting backup. He's requesting backup. But it's me, Officer Cookie. I didn't do anything. Wait a minute. She's an officer, too. Wait, she's a firefighter. This is so weird. This is so weird. She's filling up her car with gas. She's filling up her car with gas because they all have their shields. Sir, face away. Who are they talking to? Sir, face away. Driver, face away. I'm not the driver. I am not the driver. I am not the driver. I didn't do it. Well, he's getting banned. They're taking him down to the station. Look at this. Officer. Okay, all the officers are just talking. Can I take this police car? I'm an officer, too. Can I take this purple car? They're keeping this guy down. Oh, no. Run. Oh, no. He got the officers. Ran me over. Here we go. We're going. All units, he's requesting all units to the ramp. Did they get him? Did they get the bad guy? Where's that purple car at? And again, next time, I will not say anything. Now I'm riding in the back with the officer. 
Oh, here's the station. Please. Out. Oh, good. You took me to the station. Thank you. Perfect. Now I can go in here. Oh, good. I can put on my outfit again. Officer Cookie. Officer Cookie. Yes. Click. I've got a taser, and I got some handcuffs. My weapon. Oh, I need my police pants. There we go. OOH, it's getting dark out. Let's go back into the station. Here we go. Says the alarms went off at the museum. We should go check it out. Where is the museum? Hey, wait a minute. What's that prisoner doing right there? What's going on? They're running you're back over here now. He took my vehicle. Oh, but there's a helicopter. Oh, no. There's another robber. A jewelry robbery going on. I'm, like, lost in the city. Where is everybody? There we go. We're going. There's another officer right there. Try to keep up. Try to keep up. Turn. There's a jewelry store. What's going on over here? That's another officer jewelry store. Looks fine to me. It's closed, but the doors are locked. Somebody's $500,000 car. 
Whoa. Okay, I'm in. Whoa. Oh, we're on a high speed chase. Get him. Come on. Get them. Run. It's a prisoner. Get over here. She's handcuffed. You're going to jail. There's another girl. Get her. Get her. Got her. She's arrested. Get in. I'm in, I'm in. Where are you at? The bad guy right there. Get him cuffed. No way for me. Oh, wait. I'm at the station. So we'll just go in. Somebody's flying that helicopter. Go into the police station. Hey, what are you doing? Got her. She got arrested. She can't come into the police station like that. Sorry. Hey, you come back here right now. She's trying to get away. No, I fell. There's another prisoner trying to make a run for it. Hopefully she didn't escape. 
There they are. No. Oh, there's some police right over here. What's going on? Oh, no. Somebody's going to jump. No, it's okay. If you really want to, I can jump. No, don't let him jump. If you jump. Just letting you know, ma'am. Oh, okay. I'll get back. I'll get back. I'll get back. Step away. Okay, I'm back. I'm stepped away. I'm sorry, officer. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. They don't know that I'm also an officer, too. Okay. He said thank you. You're welcome. You're welcome. What is going on? Hey. Somebody keeps trying to throw me in jail. I am a police officer. There we go. Officer Cookie is back on duty. People keep thinking I'm a prisoner. Hey, behave. Hey. He's shooting at me. Hey. Hey. Get back here right now. No. Oh, that's it. You are going down. That's it. Where did those prisoners go? There they are. They got the helicopters out. Well, I'm hanging on. No. Whoa. No. I'm hanging onto the helicopter. Let me go. I'm Officer Cookies. Let me go. 
No. I don't know. Let me go. No. Oh, no. I died. Look at who else I found. My cookie fan. Yay. We're twins. We're twin officers. Yay. Cookies. You can't tell who is who. OOH. Everybody would get so confused and not know which one is the real Cookies. Rafe, is it yours? Me? I don't know, because we look like twins. Oh, no. Somebody's shooting. No. No. Run. Everybody needs to run. Twin, come on. Run. There's gunfire. There's gunfire. There's gunfire. This way. We're going to start tasing, people. Hey, you. Get over here. All right, we got him. We arrested the guy. OOH. There's a prisoner in here. We should probably close the door. What is he doing? What did you do to be in jail? Me and my Officer Twin want to know. He's trying to escape, you guys. No. He's trying to escape. No, he escaped. He escaped. No. Where did he go? Where did he go? I knew it. We should have just kept him in his cell. We got him.

Hey, get down from there, you fake weirdo. You're a fraud. That's all you are. You're not even the real antman is the Avengers. Oh, hey, would you look at that? The owner of the game. Very nice. I like your hatch, young man, you are even more handshunt in person facts. You smell so real. How do you do that? Do you make it so that I'm always the murderer? He's not gonna say yes. There's no way. He's like, I hate this guy already. Mr. President, how do you feel about the Coronavirus? I I hate the corona. I hate it. It should go away. Oh, my God. He did it. He actually did it. I didn't know he could do that. That's amazing. I Love You sketches. The murderer. Shoot him. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm not. Don't even think about touching this gun. Don't look at me. It's glass. Nice try. I got him. Please don't ban me. You made the game. I don't make the rules. There's a few more people I will find. You, retired emo kid got me, y'all. 
One V, one me. The winner gets murder mystery too. Everything. The whole thing. If I win, it's mine. If the game is mine. What if you win? You get my YouTube channel. And then if I win, I get the game. But then we can beat each other. This is amazing. I'm always the murderer. What a great guy. Guys, there's a bunch of rumors going around that Nicholas, the creator of Murder Mystery, is actually a really great guy. And I'm here to confirm that I'm the murderer. Oh, yeah. No surprise there. I'm stalking my first target. My prey has been acquired. A beautiful specimen, no doubt. Yes. Yes. And I got through the door, and you got stuck in the door. Oh, no. I'm not the murderer anymore. 
My powers are gone. Oh, and not nice going, bro. You got me stabbed when I could have been murderer for the fifth time in a row. But no, you threw that right out the window, didn't you? Didn't you know, you did use your edgy owner commands on me. I know you have them, and I need you to use them on me. You see that? Ask and you shall receive. Because he made my head really big. It's a really rare thing in robots. I could barely fit through this doorway. Coming back up and I'm dead. We are definitely going to win this year's gymnastics competition. We have what it takes. We're going to the playoffs, whatever it is for cheerleading or it's him. I know it. Got him. Ha. It wasn't him. Nice once. He's very upset. He did not like that. He gave me the angry eyes. Never good. It's never a good sign. Well, if you don't like it, ban me. Ban me. You don't like it so much. 
Owner of the game. Great Lord Roblox legend. Oh, I'm the murder you gave me. That's not banning me. That's enabling my bloodthirst. Don't move. No, you moved. Yes. Don't mess with me. I go crazy. One person I have to watch out for is Nicholas. Because he's the only one who truly knows that I am the murderer. And I have been the murderer. Except him. I guess I guess he knows, too. 1% 1%. Don't be spoiled. I'm I'm not spoiled. I'm not good. It's not what I want. It's just not what I wanted. Let's feed each other pizza. Cheers. Cheers, mate. Yes. Yes. Yes. Dad gave me 94%. Yes. I'm gonna start with you. Both of you, because you don't have shirts on. This is a Christian channel. Put clothes on. No, no, no. Put the gun down. I saw you take that. Why is this person AFK? 
I thought you had the gun for a second. You scared me. Yo, man, she had the gun all along. I know it. I mean, I didn't, but I like to believe I did know something. Hey, we going. I'm actually doing good. Sketch will never find me. Dude, this guy thinks I'm an idiot. He thinks I don't know the secrets of the map. I know the secrets of the map. They're not that secret. Oh, yeah. I hope that was him. I hope I actually killed him and not somebody that looks like him. Get back here with that gun. No, not today. Come in. I'm not coming down there. Yes. Wait, who's left? Oh, somebody's hiding from me. The only other hiding place I know is in here. Nope. Okay. That's okay. Maybe he is hiding from me somewhere. I don't know. Who's left is not good. I only got 40 seconds. I get that. Finally. Come on. Come on. I won. Come on. Keep me safe, dad. I don't want the big bad man to hurt me. 
Where you going? Oh. In here. Yeah, that's good. We could hide in here, or we can go to my penthouse. Whoa. There's, like multiple levels to this. You can go in this one, and then and then there's another one that's super secret. Oh, well, I died. It's the new dance. Everybody's doing it. It's called the keep doing it. Don't stop. Picture everyone. Say cheese. I don't trust you. Leave me alone. I don't trust you. Stop running. I'm innocent. Sounds good. I shot him. Oh. I told you. I'm sorry. Yes. Okay. The clothes seems to be clear. I did not do that. Someone else did that. I wasn't paying attention. I didn't do that. Why would you assume such business of me, young man? I dare say that you are accusing me of a crime, sir, that I did not commit. I see you there. Yes. I think they're on to me, boys. 
I think they're on to me. They'll never take me alive. You'll never take me alive. Head over here. Get. What? Oh, he's good. Or maybe I'm bad. One of the two that was a little OOH. What's up? We go get both. No. So close, man. I mean, not really. You know, that me again. Oh, my God, guys, they think the owner of the game has a crush on me or something. He keeps giving me murderer. You're not going anywhere. You're not going anywhere. I'm crazy. I'll do it. Get in the shower. No. Dang it. I was holding him hostage. Oh, you know, I was just working on a big update in the background, but it's top secret. Don't put this in the video. What if it's in the video? What would have it? You're going to kiss me or something? All right, now everyone hold hands so we can form into the Power Friends. They're like the Power Rangers. It's not the same thing. Don't sue me. Power friends activate. 
Just play a scene from the Transformers. Transformers. I mean, Powerage Team. Want to be on my team. Being my team owner, creator of game. Theming is for noobs. Facts, bro. Facts. All right. Jeez. I know how to read a room, guys. God. Get off. That's not sanitary. Smell like something's cooking. Something's cooking on a grill. This man was murdered by Burger King. Now I'm going to make a bunch of human patties. No. Put that down. Put that down. You put that down. I'm just trying to run a family restaurant. I don't see what the big deal is. You guys are jealous. Most of my success, clearly you guys just don't want to admit that my restaurant was selling patties like hot cakes. They were flying off the shelves. Flying off the shelves. And you guys just wanted a piece of it for yourself. So you had to kill me. You kill me in cold blood. Let me tell you something. My business was completely ethically and morally okay with a 1% chance I got Murderer against all the odds. 
This is a perfect time to mess with Nicholas because he has no idea that I'm in. He probably thinks I didn't get it like every other round. Yeah. Guys, guess what. Guys, guess what? Group hug, guys. Get it real close, guys. Come on. Come on. Yes. You have the gun, don't you? Don't you? No, she doesn't. Oh, my God. Odd. I'm so scared. Come in, dumb movement. I remind you. Yes. That was the king throw. That was a king. Did you see that? How did I get that person? Camper? I'm not a camper. I'm a lot of things. I ain't no camper, lady. How I hate this game. This game is for losers. Whoever made this game is 0%. 
Everyone thinks I'm the murder now everyone thinks I'm the murder. Everyone thinks it wasn't me. No, but dumb. You got dumb disease, buddy. I think there's something wrong with your hand there, bud. Something wrong with your hand. Do you see that? Am I the only one that sees that? You need surgery, big guy. I hate to break it to you. You should make that stop. You shot. Is that ant? I'm such a big fan of your YouTube channel. Let me in the box, please. Is that blood? Is that is that blood right there? Yeah, that's blood. Die. Die. Die. Die. Die. Die. Die. Hazely hey. Me and him a tight. Yeah. You tell me if you were the murderer, right? You tell me if it was really you, right? 
We're friends.

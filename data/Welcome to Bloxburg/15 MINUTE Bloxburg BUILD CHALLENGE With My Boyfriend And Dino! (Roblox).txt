Are you guys ready for a build challenge? No. Yeah. No. Wait, why not? Because I'm scared. Okay, well, listen up. Are you scared? 15 minutes to build the best house ever. Are you ready, Dino? I think I'm ready, Santa. Uh, I guess so. All right, listen, the timer starts now. Now. I'm still in the car. How are you supposed to do this? You're supposed to run to your plot and start building. Dino, put them on the other side of town. Oh, my God. The 15 minutes have started, and I don't even know what to do. I don't have a plan. Oh, my God. It was so long, Daglo, since I was actually building in this game in Blacksburg, that I don't even know what to do right now. This is going to be so difficult. But I need to impress them. I for sure need to impress them. How about I get, like, elevator? Oh, my God. At the entrance to my house, there's an elevator. How cool would that be? Oh, my God. 

Okay, well, how about I do that, actually? Oh, my God. That was very, very expensive. I'm going to get rid of these walls again, and I need to replace the walls now. This is going to be so difficult. Okay. This is going to look so cool. The entrance of my house is just going to be an elevator. Okay, so I need to color this pink. I think I'm going to make it look really cute. And there we go. Doesn't that look cute? I think it looks cute, yes. And then we need to get started with multiple floors. Oh, my God, I am so scared right now. I need to win this build challenge. That's the floor. Okay, now we need to move on. Wait. Oh, no. I just forgot. There's only two floors. The lob only goes to two floors. I can only make two floors. Oh, no, this is not good. Okay, so what I'm going to do is make it very, very big. Like this. Is this even big? I don't even know. Oh, my God. I only have twelve more minutes. I literally only have twelve more minutes. How am I supposed to finish this off? Oh, my God. Okay, floor. 

Let's add the floor. Oh, my God. It doesn't find the floor. Of course it doesn't. Why? It's a square. Okay, here we go. Oh, wait, wait. Oh, no, I forgot. I need to build around the elevator. Of course, that makes sense. Like this. I think that's how it works. I just realized when you enter the enter it here. You will come out of here. Oh, no. Well, I'll just make it like this. This is the entrance. This is the entrance. I don't even know what to do. What to start with. Okay, I think we're going to color the floor white, and we're going to make it marble. We need to get the marble one. Okay, now we need to make the rooms. I mean, we need to have a dining area. We need to have the bedroom and stuff. How am I going to do this? So I guess this is going to be the bathroom right over here. We need to go to decoration. We need to get a toilet in here. Right over there. We need to get sinks as well. We for sure need to get sinks. Oh, no, this is so difficult. We need the counters. Okay, let's place them over here. 

Perfect. That looks amazing. And can we get like, a carpet, a rug or something? I don't even know. I can't concentrate on that right now because literally almost half of the time is gone and I have basically done nothing. Okay, I'm going to get this bed right over here because you can actually add a chair and have your computer in here. So I'm going to go into appliances. And that's not computers at all. The computers are in the electronics. I am messing up so much right now. Okay, I've got my computer right over there. We need to color this so it looks a little bit cute, at least. Here we go. And there we go. Okay, perfect. I guess this one. The toilet could also be pink. Why not? Okay. Oh, my God. House bills. I need to pay house bills. Are you serious right now? Oh, no. How am I going to have time for all of this? How is that going to be possible? Oh, no, I actually think I need to delete this right here. I don't know. I actually have no idea. It might look really weird when we go up in the elevator after. 

We also need to get a roof down. How am I supposed to do this all so quick? Okay, kitchen. Kitchen. We need to get started with the kitchen. Let's start with the counters. Let's just get some down right now. Oh, no. Come on, come on. Okay, right there. Now we need to go to appliances. Appliances. And we need to get a fridge over there. We also need to get one of these stoves. Oh, my God. That does not look very good. Okay, it looks very good. Looks very, very good. Okay, I'm basically just changing all the colors at once. Okay, what about rugs? We need, like, doors. This is not good at all. Okay, so the doors we're going to go for OOH, commercial. No, we're not going to go for that. I think we're just going to go for like, an opening. Two openings, just like that. And we're going to make them wise, completely wise. Bright white, like this. And we're going to have a dining room area right over here. 

We need tables. Where are the tables at? I'm struggling. Where is tables? Why tables? Oh, my God. I found it. How did that take such a long time to find? What kind of table do I want now? Okay, I'll go for this one. I'll go for this one. And we are going to be coloring it white, just like that. And then we need to go for chairs. And we'll just take these normal ones because I don't have much time to really do anything different. Come on. I feel like it's more difficult now than ever to build in luxury. I don't know why. It could also be because I'm very, very stressed right now. And we also need to change the color of these rugs. Okay. We definitely need to change the color of this because this does not really look good, does it? All right. Looks amazing. We also need oh, my God, five more minutes. We need windows. Windows. We definitely need some windows. We need some very, very nice windows. We're going to have some huge windows, which is like a huge view. 

Just like that. I just remembered now that we do need more doors. A door into the bedroom and one into the bathroom. Yes. It's just going to be glass. Door. Why not just like this? Beautiful. What about, like, a fireplace or something? This inches area looks so boring right now. How about more windows? Where did I find the windows again? Windows right here. It's just going to be a very light space. There's going to basically be windows everywhere. Oh, my God, I totally forgot a ceiling. I need to remember to put a ceiling down. I need to have more windows, though. More windows. Many more windows. Do I want a huge window into my bedroom? Probably. Do I want a huge one out of my bathroom? Probably not. We're going to go for a smaller window. Okay, we have, like, three minutes left now. And how we're going to do this, I honestly have no clue. 

But we are just going to place this window right here. Just like that. Beautiful. We do also need a ceiling. We definitely do need a ceiling. Fireplaces. How about a cute little fireplace while we're doing this? This doesn't even fit. Does that look okay? Yeah, that looks beautiful. That looks could not look any better than it does. Plants. Oh, my God. I totally forget about plants and ceiling. Oh, my God. We need to add a ceiling, but then we could do that in the end because probably everyone's going to forget about that. So we're going to go ahead and find decorations. We for sure need decorations. Plants. Okay. Here we've got the plants. No plants here. Got a plant right over there. Right over there. Right over there. We're just going to put a lot of plants down to make it look very cute. What else do we have? What else is it that we need? I don't know. This is so difficult. I know I'm going to forget, like, really important things. How about we add a sink in here? 

There we go. Beautiful. And then another one right over there. Time is up. Dino, we're going to check out your house first. Is that okay? That's fine by me. I just opened up my doors. I can allow guests. We got to drive there. Oh, no. I've known because I hope yours is worse than mine. Well, really? Why? Oh, my God. I know. My house is the worst. Oh, my goodness. Wait, what is this right there? This house right here. Wait. It's beautiful. Yeah, you like it? Dino's house. You just forgot the ceiling in one part. That's the ceiling. It's a glass ceiling. Okay, listen, it is your tour. Listen. Yes, I'd like to eat pizza occasionally. 

Okay? I don't always have guests when I eat pizza, but that's my trash pile. Okay, don't mind the trash. We're here to check out my house, which is not if you want jelly. If you want to eat that, you can eat that. Bud Challenge gets to eat that slice. You can eat that slice of pizza if you win. Come on, show me your house. Okay, let's get the old the Dino house. Okay. So this is the first room. It's pretty interesting. I have a glass ceiling. All right. You like it? Yes. It's a full machine. If I stand right here, it says a little fart machine. I've never really seen a house with a glass ceiling for the entrance. It's a glass ceiling. See, I thought that would be really welcoming. Very nice. It's like, look, the natural lighting. Oh, wait, that's my bedroom. That's my bedroom. I'd go there last. So what do you want to show us next? I mean, the next spot for my guest in my house? The living space. 

That's right. I live here. Yeah. Crazy, right? Trash. Trash. That's pizza. You can eat that one right there if you want. It's a little dark in here. I'm going to be honest. This is my TV corner. Okay. This is kind of a darkness. No, you're supposed to watch TV and have natural lights. It's through the windows, guys. Oh, yeah, the TV. The Broadway. When you watch TV, you look at the background. I had some redecorating. I thought the guests would enjoy watching TV from the hammock. Sometimes I do that. It works perfect. Thank you. I believe it. So what's in here? Yeah, what's in here? Watch that later. So past the kitchen. It's a small kitchen. This is the bathroom. I'm taking a shower at Dinosaur. Ready? That's close. I got to wash my hands on. 

Yes, they do. Sending. Who doesn't shower with their clothes on? Yeah, that's how you clean your clothes, right? Yes. And this is where I use the bathroom sometimes I go number one and number two. Okay, we got to go. Jelly's using it right now. Make sure you wash your hands and then I'm coming over to the bedroom. Okay. Can I join? Yeah, of course. The door is always open. Hello. So this is my bedroom. I wouldn't say it's anything master, but it is definitely a bed and a room. It's a bedroom. My laundry. Yeah. I don't know what I just picked up here. That's my dirty laundry. Dinos laundry. Looks like a rock. No way. Don't make fun of my dirty clothes. Right? I just wear a lot of rock colors. All right, we come back to the full circle all the way around. 

We only have 15 minutes, so I'm not going to judge this yet. I think it's all right. Okay. Yeah, you think it's all right? Dars. I'm going to give it a I might give it a three. I might give it an eight. Wait, she's backing up one and a half. Gave me one and a half next. Then let's see how well yours is. We're going to count up the points in the end. And I don't want to vote for anyone yet because I don't want anyone to vote me down just because I gave you a bad star. You gave me one and a half of my first house. I am. She's taking us to your house now. We're going to both our houses. They're opposite. Oh, yeah, that's right. You guys are on the better side of town. Yeah, that's how you fill the eye off it's okay. It's okay. I panicked. There's no seatbelts here. It's a golf car, dude. All right. Are you guys ready to say I see something in the distance? What is good. 

Thanks. So over here because that's jelly south. We're not going to check that out. The left one is fine. That one's further. All right. Do you see this? What's wrong? It's just a door. Oh, no. I need to call the elevators. Coming. Squash me. I'm not getting in that. It almost got me. Come on, guys. Get in your house. This doesn't make sense. It's floating. Yes, it is. It's beautiful. Come on. Don't peek. How am I supposed to peek? It's all the way up there. Yes. This is my entrance area where you enter. And you can look over at Deli South. They'll do it, though. Wait. Whoa. Ceiling. Oh, yeah. Nice. I really like the glass. We have the kitchen. And I made food for you guys, so you can have just saying this is next level. 

And how did you make this in 15 minutes? What do you mean? Oh, my goodness. Oh, I took all the muffins. I didn't mean to do that. I'm going to eat all the pancakes. Guys. I'm going to eat them eating all the pancakes. Okay. All right. I don't know how to eat all the pancakes. Okay. Over here, the bathroom with also a lot of windows so that people can be why do you have a cancun in your bathroom? You scrub yourself with it in the shower? Yeah. Is that a loophole? Really? I have my bedroom and my office. What the heck? That's awesome. People play games and sleep in it. I want to set up like that. I want to be able to sleep on top of my gaming room. Mind me, guys. I'm going to start gaming real quick. 

One of my new skills. Okay, let me get back. Let's check out Jelly's house now and see how good that one is. This is pretty crazy, right? She has a floating house with glass windows everywhere. I don't know how this makes any sense. All right, let's go to mine, boys. Okay, let's get in the elevator. Sorry. This place is so exciting. I didn't know you could have an elevator in your house. I know. We just went through the floor. Yeah, we did. Let's not talk. All right, next up on the list is Jelly Town. The Jelly mansion, everybody. You all enter my lovely home. Yeah. Wow. Looks like the lights are turned off. How do I turn the lights on? Maybe you have to pay your bills. Wait, there we go. And then you need to get one of those light switches so you can turn all the lights on at once. Oh, you need a light switch. 

Hold on. All right, Jelly, turn the letter. There we go. Lights are on. Welcome to Casa Jelly. Casa Jelly. Yeah. Now, I built a 1918 Spanish styled villa oh. So the moment you enter the house, immediately can get cozy. You know, that's how we like it. That's how we like it. Yeah. I don't have permission to sit on the couch. No, you don't, because you don't live here. You're very true. Five stars. You get permission to sit on my couch. Five stars. Don't do it. Don't deal with Dino. Oh, my goodness. It's hilarious. Over here we've got a fireplace. Just if your hands get cold, we keep it next to the fire. You know what I'm saying? Yes. Over here we've got the toilet. This toilet is really going to bring your score down. 

Jelly. What? No color on this wall over here. Don't like it. It's just a toilet in a room. Yeah. Boring, right? What else do you put in your toilet room? I don't know. Wait, I'd try it out. But I don't have permission to use your toilet. It's really nice to be able to stare at your neighbors while sitting on the toilet. Just looking. Over at Santa's house. Yeah. Okay. You can do that. From here. Through this door, we've got the kitchen. What? EW. Wow. I only had 15 minutes, just like you guys, and I was really struggling, so I just put a barbecue down. That's awesome. Barbecue. Throw a party if we need to. But apart from that, I really pretty much got nothing in here. Okay. You got a dishwasher? Yeah. Over here through this store, we've got the garage. You've got my beautiful Beep Beep car. It's very fast, by the way. Yes. That car Go Beeps, it breaks world records. 

The bedroom nice and cozy in here. I know. Wow. I do like to work out as well here. Beautiful pillars. Yes, we really like them all the time. That's how we get stroll, dude. Nice. We wake up at 80. We work out. That's impressive. And over here, this is something you guys don't have, is my terrace with a shower? Yeah. It's always so nice and warm outside that I shower outside. Real? That's crazy. You living here and doesn't really matter. Your neighbor is still spying. That's the inside guys. And I actually worked a little bit on the outside. Don't hit your head while going down. Don't hit your head. No, don't hit your head. I'm a short guy. I don't do those things. This is my garden. He's got a place to sit and a pool. That's neat. 

Oh, can I jump into that pool? I like the great. I'm ready to swim. I just got to do my arm stretches. Jump right in. We got a swing. Well, but you still can't sit on that as well because we don't have permission. I can push him to vote. It's really dark out. It's really dark out. Let's do it inside. Okay, well, I do want to say, Santa, your house was fantastic. I like the pink and the windows. Thank you, jelly's house. Jelly, your house is interesting. I didn't know what theesthetic you were going for, but those pillars really brought it all together. Yeah, the pillars in the bedroom and the barbecue in the kitchen. It's the bathroom. Well, the bathroom is my least favorite, I'm not going to lie. Look, I'm really sad about this bathroom because there's one gigantic window and no lights if I go to the bathroom at night 

when the lights are on. Also, I need to know where I'm going. Otherwise I might just hit the floor. Yeah. All right, so it's time to vote. How many stars does Dino get? Dino from me gets three stars and Santa from me gets five stars. Okay, santa's, five stars from you. Wow. It's crazy. All right, I'm going to give Santa's house three stars. I enjoyed it, but there's way too many windows. All right. Okay. No privacy. And, Jelly, I'm going to give yours a four. No way. Okay, well, I'm going to give you guys one star each, and then we have the winner. Santa. What? Are you kidding me? Santa is the winner? Oh, come on. That must be cheating. 

No, it's not. Unbelievable. I got the lowest score outside of my house. Go enjoy your own els, you bloody cheater. Now let's party upstairs. Yeah, that sounds great. I understand. You know, I got this, right? I can easily glitch in. What do you mean? Wait, what? Yeah, I can glitch in. Glitch in? Is that possible? She's going to sneak in.

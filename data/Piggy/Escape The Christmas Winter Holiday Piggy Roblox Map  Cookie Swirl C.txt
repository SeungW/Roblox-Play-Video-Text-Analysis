Oh, man, I got to go outside. What do we have? This is like the garden. It's like a little hay garden. There's a present. It needs a dreidel. This is like a little ice maze. Nothing here. Oh, wait, there's a present here. It needs a sword. Ugh. Lost in the trees. Giant snowball. Look at how short the time is. Is this like a five minute map?

He doesn't know where to go. No, this way, this way, this way, this way. He has no idea what he's doing. This way. What is he doing to Piggy? He's just hanging out with Piggy. Piggy's just dancing to the car. First number is five. This is where he needs to go. This is where the screwdriver goes. Oh, no, they're messing up the numbers. Five. It's the first number. Did he open this? Did he open it? I heard a screwdriver sound. Oh, I guess it was just doggy. Come on, screwdriver over here. Piggy is trying to take me now. Yes, we're back in the cabin.

She still has the shovel. Wait. What else do we we need? What else do we need? Okay, this present is gone. Are we going to do it, Piggy? Why? Please go away. We need the dreidel. The dreidel. The present is still right here. Less than a minute left. Is it going to be a Christmas miracle? Is it? Where's the dreidel? Where's the dreidel? There it is. I found it. Nobody thought to check in that back corner. There's not enough time. 20 seconds. There's not enough time. There's no way. There's no way. There's enough time. 8 seconds.

Okay, I got the sword. This goes into the ice castle. Little ice area. Okay, put the sword in. This is for Zizzy. Click it. I can hear Piggy. You put the gifts under the tree. Piggy is totally behind me. There's the white key. I need to get the white key. But there's there's Owl right there. Click. I got the white key. I got the white key open. Need to go back for the carrot. I look like Densa. Oh, the carrot is gone. Wait, no, it was in the ice. It was in the ice.

This is for Pony. Pony's going to love it. Closed door. Here's the present. Okay, how many more presents do we need? There's less than two minutes left. Okay, what about the dreidel? What about the dreidel? Last time it took me forever to find the dreidel. See that the present is still there. We still need to find the draidel. Okay, go back to the maze. We're both looking for it. We're both looking. I found it back here last time. Yes, it's still there. Almost less than a minute. Oh, come on, please, please. Let's do this now. Piggy. 40 seconds. Come on, draidel. Okay, for Jurassic. This is it. This is the last present. Put it under the tree. Is that it? No, we need one more present. Which present do we need? Is it the book? No, I think it's the book. Oh, that was so close. We almost did it. Kick time. For real? Yeah. All right, let's do it again. Here we go. Here we go. I know we can do this. I know we can beat this map. All right, here is the sword with the fencing. Oh, Piggy. No. 

Instantly. Just like that. Really? Okay, put that here. I have to circle around. I'll circle around. Grab the present. Okay. This is for Zizzy. Okay, here's the present. Let's get the draidel. Since that one kind of is like holding me up always at the end. Oh, it's not there. Maybe somebody else got it. Is there no draidel in here? Present. What does that want with the robot? Are you piggy? Yes. Okay, this is open. We just need the carrot. So I should go to the garden. Carrot is in the garden. Oh, piggy, piggy, piggy, piggy. Okay, she's got it. Okay, she's going to go put it in the tree. Are we still looking for the shovel? I think we're looking for the shovel because we still need the book for this present. That one's going to be for Mimi. Oh, Piggy. Mimi. Oh, he killed her. He got her. Where is the shovel? Okay, before, I was just kind of, like, laying out in the snow. Oh, no. I don't know if we're going to be able to do it. Who has the shovel? Let's check the garden again. No, it's definitely not here. But all the snow piles are gone, so maybe somebody already shoveled the snow. Oh, Piggy, please don't follow me with the white key. Don't need the white key. Go around this way. No. Game over. Wait. The present is gone. The shovel's just left. What is going on with my legs? I'm, like, stuck. I'm stuck crouching. 

Look, I'm running normal speed, but I'm still crouching. Okay, here's the dreidel. I don't know what's going on with my legs. Seriously, I'm pressing control, and it still will not let me get up. All right, let's open here. Get the dreidel. Oh, Piggy, go to the garden. Hopefully Piggy can't see me. Maybe if I'm crouched down like this pig, you can't see me at all. Put in the dreidels. Okay, I got it. I got your wrappy's gift. Okay. Present. There's the carrot. There's the book. There's the book. I can't forget about the book. Maybe I should get the book. No, he's got it. Is he going to get it? No, he didn't get it. All right, here's a small present for Pony. Now we need the book. The book is gone. Oh, there it is. Book. This was in the house. Put it in here for Mimi. Still don't know why I'm crouching. All right, what else do we need? I got the dreidel. Did we get this present? No, we need the sword. We need the little fencing sword board. No, Piggy. Oh, I saw it. I saw it. It's in here, but I won't be able to be quick enough to go get it. There's, like a minute left. Wait, where is it? Where is it? Where is it? It's in this one. Piggy is coming. Okay, I got it. No, it's a shovel. No, I got the wrong thing. Wait, there it is. Okay, I got it. I'll never make it. I'll never make it. This map is so tricky. Wait, maybe I can make it in time to put it in there. Grab it and go. Go, go, go, go, go, go. 

Put it under the tree. Hurry. There's. Piggy, please, piggy. No. I closed the door on myself. I put it in. Yes. We did it. We did it. Yay. You won't believe what just happened. Some weird creature was chasing me this whole time. Did any of you even see it? I even ran through the cabin with it behind me. Strange we didn't see that at all. Also, did you just run out and find all the gifts for us? Look, what matters is that we're all together. I agree. So now that we're here, let's exchange gifts. Thank you so much for the carrot. I'll try my best just to save it for later, but I really want to eat it now, and I absolutely love this book. I will be reading it over and over for a while. All right, what about you, little cute C's? Zoosy says a fencing foil. Now I can be just like Zizzi. Careful, Zoo. And be sure to share that with Z until we get another. Thank you so much. This looks just like the one back at home, and it means so much to me. OOH. Draddle. Come on, everyone. Let's go play. Happy holidays, everyone. Zizzy. Whoa. We did it. Okay, I think I'm, like, permanently in, like, this crouch position until I, like, reset my game. I'm just going to have to kneel. 

Ah, but now I can relax right here by the fire. Oh. It kind of looks like I'm, like, sitting down and, like, leaning forward, if you didn't know that I was just kneeling. Big hugs to my cookie fans who played some piggy with me today. I hope you guys have a very magical day today, and I'll see you guys in my next video. Bye, you guys. OOH, look at all these presents under the tree. Cookies were see.

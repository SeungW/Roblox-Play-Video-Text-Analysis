Only made. 

I cannot go in there. And we have last but not least, the last door, which is sweet bee. I think my roommates are pretty dirty. Lunar. What do we do with roommates that are very messy? Gosh, you just leave it dirty until they say, oh, no, it's too disgusting. I have to clean it up or they can just oh, okay. So I will become dirtier than them. I'll throw pizza. Wait, that's not how it works. No. Okay, well, I hope you guys enjoyed the ice storm. Very cool. We loved it. Thank you. Thank you. What was that? I think you snowmen just talked to us. Is that you, Olaf? No, I'm joking. No, Rainbow, the snowmen don't talk in here. They're just regular snowmen. I think you drank too much soda pop, so we're going to have to ask you to chill axe a bit. Maybe it's a few cold in here. What you guys are about to see is my dorm.

No commitment. Wait, guys. Luna, I don't want to go to your door. No way. I'm just kidding. But we have to take a tour. We did a tour of everybody's room. Guys, don't you want to see what the dark room looks like? Okay, but Jacko just cried and ran away. Okay, we're ready. Go through really quick. Just get out right away. 

Who died in here? Lies. Okay. A lot of people died in here, Lunar. The storm scares me a lot. This scary sounds in here. What do you eat? Regular things. And maybe some souls. Why? Kidding. Why does this say strawberry solar pop? Those aren't souls. They're just regular soda pop. So where do you guys sleep? Yeah, we sleep upstairs. You want to see? Okay. I don't want to be rude, but do you sleep in coffins or something? Oh, my gosh. Just kidding. Wait, you guys. What the heck is this?

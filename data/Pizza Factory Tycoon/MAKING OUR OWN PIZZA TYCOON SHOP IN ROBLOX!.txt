It's the evil girls that try to stab us. She said, Can I have pizza? No, you stabbed us when we were noobs. So we're not gonna let you in. She took this knife and she shaved us, and they were, like, laughing. Hey, guys, welcome back to the channel. Today, Gold and I have taken all of our piggy bank money yeah. And bought a pizza place or factory. Yes, we did. Now we have to build it up. It doesn't look like it so far, but we are working on it. First, we have to start making pizzas by stepping on this pine. Why isn't it working? Oh, there it is. Yours is the red side. Oh, silly. Sorry, Gold. Let me start my pizza place. Whoa, look at all the money. We got the pizzas. All right, so first, this is fine. It is dropping tiny slices of pizza out of this machine. Gold, how is your pizza going? We could buy another one. I have a slice. I make slice. 

Is your pizza, like, human? What? No, gold, don't start in the human thing. Look. Oh, this is so cool. So this is I'm pretty sure I forgot to read it, but look, it's green and red, little cubes. And as soon as they go throughout this part, they turn into pizza. All right. Oh, I had to go collect the money over here. Let's collect it. And it looks like you've purchased a scooter maker. So the scooter maker drops scooters out so we could deliver the pizza. Let's see. We can purchase Magic Spice for $10,000. OOH, that's kind of expensive. You know what? 10,000? Why not? There we go, buddy. Bought this? Yes. Gold, you should get a door. Oh, yeah. Now we are going to buy a door, because earlier, those girls next door, they were very mean guys. They took out their knives and they shived us. 

Yeah, they did. And now we have to buy this to block them out. But we could also purchase walls and ceiling lights. Oh, that's for Gold side. Let's see. I could purchase more conveyor walls so the pizza doesn't fall out. And we could purchase walls on my side. Okay, what else do we got? What you got? Stairs. Funny. Nice. Pretty cool, huh? Now we could purchase some more walls, cover this place up. Purchase some more walls. Purchase some more walls. Scooter. Let's just get that. Oh, nice. Is it me or making pizza? A lot of money. Look at all the money we're getting per second. I know, right? I'm surprised. Okay, this game is fairly simple. We have the pizza going through getting transformed into pizza. And yeah, it goes through this thing and it makes the pizza magical. Look at this girl. She's trapped in our factory. You shall work here forever, rainbow glitter girl in our magic advice. 

Let's get some of that. I'm going to go upstairs, Gold. I want to see what's upstairs. Maybe I shouldn't be running on the conveyor belt. Wait for me. I want to go upstairs. Hey, Gold, clean up this place. Look at it. There's a piece of mess all over the floor. I actually put that there on purpose. Oh, for design? Yeah. Okay, so let's see. We could buy a second conveyor belt. Honestly, I feel like this Tycoon game is really simple. Much more simple than grocery store. We could buy a pizza machine. Once again, let's go upstairs and purchase an advanced pizza machine. Let's see. Upgrade. Pizza machine. Upgrade. I wonder what upgrading a pizza looks like. Drop out the pizza. Pizza dropper. Let's see. It turns into a pie and when it goes through it, it seems like it gets more crispy. 

Okay, let's buy more. Whoa, Gold. This game is way too easy. Funny, I think. Look at this. It's been a very successful pizza place. Yes, super successful. And purchase a pizza delivering scooter. We'll get another. Oh, no. I don't have enough money. BRP, I'm going to go grab some more money from the money machine. Let's grab it. We have 89K now. So with 89K money going in yes, so much money. With 89K, we could purchase a delivery. We have an Invader in our home. And a rainbow invader. It's okay as long as they're not killing us. What's a samurai package? Oh, I need five more. Katstand, what is the hat stand? We're going to see what a samurai package is. So we'll collect our money right here, get money and go back up. 

Hey, Gold. Gold. Yes, funny. Should we invest in a roof? People are flying in here from the top. I know, right? We totally should. Maybe it's more important to buy a roof. Whoa. And maybe some stairs for Gold. Because Gold is not using the stairs. We should buy an elevator shortcut. Funny. Who needs stairs? Now we can purchase some lights, light this place up. And Gold, I'm going to spend my money on a samurai package for 20,000. Why? That's so cool. Can I wear a samurai? Yes, you can. Can you wear it? Look at me. I'm superior. I'm a cute. Hey, welcome to Samurai Pizza, where our pizza is the top. Pizza. What's a core blocks. I wanted that one. Gold. Sorry, that was an accident. 

Don't kill me. Whoa. I look so cool now. How cool do we look while making pizzas? I make the best pizza. Whoa. There is a disaster of pizza falling down from here. Look at this gold. It looks awesome. Look how much pizza is falling down. They look so crazy. Hurry, we need to go make more pizza. Pizzas. Okay. Let's go collect some more cash. And I'm going to get out of this outfit. It's kind of heavy now. I am back changing out of my outfit. We can purchase 20,000 crates to store more pizza. We could buy photora hats, which is not necessary. We could purchase some windows and some more good old walls. You're making more money than me. What? We can have a third floor, meaning more more close. Pizza. Hashtag pizza for days, Gold. Pizza for days. I'm going to go back down and collect some money. This suit is kind of weighing me down yet. 

You're moving like a potato, Gold. You're moving. Look at me. Gold's pizza machine is not upgraded to be like my pizza machine. So, Gold, may you speed it up. I'm trying to. I don't know how much money. Like, how are you making so much money? Honestly, I do not know, Gold. Maybe my pizza is just tastier. No, mine is tastier. No, maybe mine's just super tasty. It's the evil girls that try to stab us. She said, Can I have pizza? No, you stabbed us when we were noobs. So we're not going to let you in. She took this knife and she shaved us and they were, like, laughing. Yeah, you tried to kill us. So we're going to go back upstairs. Don't worry, guys. We will open the magical pizza factory soon, and then everyone could take a look. Look what I got over here for you. 

Funny. What do you have? OOH. I'm going to unlock the magic carpet. Oh, nice foil. So we could jump to places. Hey, is this just a roof? It's not a third floor. Oh, it is a third floor. It says purchase crates. We're going to buy some more crates. Some lights up here and we are broke once again. Going down to let me enjoy these things a little more money and gold, do you have a surprise or something? I do. Look what you have a magic carpet. This is so cool. I like it. Yes, that is. I don't like your magic carpet. I kind of died. Wee. Oh, you need to know how to use it. Yeah, I think I'm glitching. No, you know what? I have to reset my character's glitching. I still need that spring to get onto the second floor. We'll grab it once again. 

What's this? A catanic. You do the second floor. Boop. No boop. There we go. Now we can purchase our lights and purchase an extension. I wonder what oh, it extended our building. Okay, a walk speed pad or more extensions. You know what? A walk speed pad? Another one. Hey, Gold, these upgrades are crazy. They are. Oh, funny. You got to unlock an ice night package down here. But that's so expensive. That is 50. Okay, let's go collect some more cash lock to unlock the night package. I have 324K, meaning night package 300. I only have 195k. Goes. Look down. Our pizza fans are waiting for us to open up our factory. I might as well be looking super cool. 

See, I got this hat, and these customers are waiting. Scary. Yeah, this looks kind of intimidating. So we're going to finish just the hiding. Yeah, you're going to finish upgrading the top first. Gold, come upgrade the top so we can open our factory. Let's see. We could buy an extension upgrade for 100. Nice. Some window. I have a motorcycle down here for you. Is it for me, Gold? Yeah, it is. You're lying. Is it? Close your eyes. Don't look. Does it actually work? Just close your eyes and come back. I'm closing my eyes. Gold. Is it? What? That is so cool. Imagine delivering pizzas in this. You're like, hey, I heard you like pepperoni. Yeah. And I'm going to deliver you want cool cheese pizza? Yup. That is super cool. And you have a golden scooter, too. Nice. 

Yes. I'm excited to deliver our pizza. Now. We have 352K. We're going to buy a health pad. Because obviously when you're in the factory, you might hurt yourself. So whoopam. Health pad. Wait, you're killing yourself. What? See? Like look gold. Oh, my gosh. You got a boo boo. Oh, no. I need to get a health pad. See? Okay, now try it on me. Gold, give me a boo boo. Okay. Ouch, ouch, ouch. Don't kill me, Gold. Okay, see? The healing pad is not working. Why isn't it working? Oh, it's working. No, it's not working. Okay, awkward. Now let's move on to the 30 jump boost. This gives us amazing boosting powers by this. Gold, it's only eighty k. Oh, it does give I'm walking too fast. I don't like this. I'm walking way too fast. Oh, no. Please let us walk slower. She was just go on ten speed and let's see. Gold could finish off her side by buying clockwork headphones. 

Cool looking headphones. And a hat. And some nice shades. Wait, you need one more over here. Oh, okay. A jump pad. Oh, I'm out of money. Be right back. There we go. Are we officially done? We officially upgraded our factory. High five. Gold, look back. Now it's time to open our factory to all of our customers. You know, they're waiting outside. They're like, I wonder when this amazing factory is going to open. Well, today is the day. Look at wait, before we open it yes, Gold, before we open it. We got to dress up for it. Oh, yes. I'm wearing my fanciest white hat. We're going to get a motorcycle. You know what we're going to grab? We're going to get all of these items so we look super cool when opening. The carpet is kind of glitchy, but that is totally fine. 

All right, we got glasses on my head. We got this fancy top pad. You ready to open our factory, Gold? We are super ready to open. Okay. I got my rainbow catana. We will not slice. Oh. Oops. Okay, wait. Let me do that again. We are opened for business, everyone. Welcome to the amazing wait, Pete, how did you open your door? Just press the green button. Oh, there we go.

And up here is where me and funny get dressed. So there's lots of chef outfits we could choose from. Exactly. Go over and pick your favorite one.

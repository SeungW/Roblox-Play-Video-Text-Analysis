Here, I'll be a really, really good guy and I'll give you the rarest item in the game. Guys. See? Look at that. Wait, can I name it and then make her have like a pet with like a really, like, maybe offensive name? Say thank you. Adopt Me is the biggest game on Roblox. It's got like 6000 players. There's hardly games, like hardly too many games in the world that can get that many players. So what am I doing by not playing it? Every time I play it, I make fun of people real. But what I don't do is I don't play it for real. So I'm going to do that. I'm hangry. First off, I need to figure out how you can you name your pet and then give it a soul with that name. So today I'm going to be getting epic rare pets. I need a shower. Can they change it so it doesn't make everybody say it at the same time? It sounds like we're all in some cult or it's like, it's shower time. 
How did I get this? Does she think I'm a pet? I'm a person. Stop. Do you want to win a unicorn? Yes. The issue with Adopt Me is like, you're going to get scammed, dude, if you play the game long enough, you'll fall for someone's scam. All right, let's get the new pet. All right. Yelling why did I do that? Now I could buy Epic Royal Egg. Wait, I don't know that. Is that the one that I need? They should make it so one out of every 500 pets? No, they should make it one out of every ten pets. It's just like dead inside their egg because isn't that how it really is? Oh, I hurt. My knee. Are you okay? My knee. What do you want, Stabiza? All right, give me something good. Give me something worth my time. Beric berry peace. What? You want the common? 
All right, whatever. You giving him back, wasn't it good enough for you? Why? What do you want? Is this what a dot me is? This is just waiting around for Stabiza to do something. Stop drooling at your screen act. Do you want I don't want any. All right, back to the regular scheduled programming. She just goes back and sits there. Oh, shout out to my dad. I'm currently recording this on my birthday and he he sent cake to my house. Rich does TikTok hate scammers? If you want to trust trade for TikTok, you first. Please don't scam. Okay. I TikTok it. I made a TikTok and I want to just film people, like endgame and be like, I love you, you're my best friend. And just like, filming and they just see that on their TikTok and they're just like, okay, I'm logging out for a blocks today. All right, I'm going to open the film her real quick. I would really like an Adopt Me pitch. 
Come on. Give me an adopt me pitch, please. All right, I'm posting that. I would really like an adopt me, Pete. All right. Oh, my God. Get off me. ABC, if you want me to name your pet like this, I am not a scammer. I have done this with many other people. I also have other fonts you can choose from ABC, please. Okay. Is it a scam? Of course it's not. Hello. I can name your pet like this. The other fonts. And no, I'm not a scammer. I've done this before. Is this scam? No, I just downloaded this app, and I'm giving font names to people. Please, please. All right, do that one. Name it. I ran out of my meds. Trade was successful. Name it. Punching Bag. Not that I condone hitting an animal, but a virtual animal. Yes. 
Imagine she actually does it. And punching bag. Yes. Look at another scammer over there. ABC to trust trade. Trust trading the turtle. You go first, though. Why does it trust trade? Oh, my God. Wait, she actually did it. Wait, what? Wait. Thank you. Okay. Don't trust people. I was 100% sure I was getting scammed. Look at Punching bag. It's mine, right? She gave it to me. It's mine, dude. Nobody's going to scam me now, sunshine. Zoe. Thank you. My dog is now named Punching Bag. I'll be a nice guy, and I'll give this guy a T. Donating changing my biggest fan's life with a big donation. I gave him a T. Oh, failed trading. Dude, people do this thing called failed Trading where they film a bad trade on their TikTok, and they're like, I don't know why I put TikTok in one of these. TikTok is real. I have a tik tok where I threw up. Oatmeal. And that's, I think, the only TikTok I did on it. 
So you'll send them all your good items, and they'll send you nothing as a funny moments video, and they swear they'll give it back. It's just for the video. So I'm going to try it. Feel straight. Peace. I go first, please. Apparently everyone just got the coronavirus or something. I feel sick. Let's go. Hospital, bro. What just happened? All right. And then we just got hit by a car. This is terrible, bro. I just got ran over a second time, bro. And he's backing up into me. Forward again. He's trying to make Mercy kill me whenever I play adopt me, man. It just brings out the sad jokes I need to be actually playing for real. All right, let's see if I can get Punching Bag back. See, ABC? I did what's an issue. Was punching Bag not good enough? Oh, this is honestly a little bit sad to watch. Who wants to trust trade? They go first. You never really see anyone shouting out, hey, trust trade. 
I'll go second. I'll do it first. I love his name. Not a scammer. I hate scammers. ABC Trust trade. You go first. I'm not a scammer. I just think it's funny. It's fun. I like doing it. Here, take punching bag. Hey, let's try this out. I'm going to make her feel worried about it. I trust you so much. Oh, she's got hit by a car. No, I was just in the process of typing. Okay, can I get it back, my trusty old pal? Because that one person renamed my pet for me. So I was like, oh, if one of them is all right, all of them are right, I might as well buy, like, 20 of these because now I need more Legendaries so people can scan me out of them. Because I think I just gave that girl, like, everything I had. 
All right, what is this? Am I going to all right, let's just go through all this. This is a really expensive process. Hey, wait. A legendary. That's good, right? It's not like I'm keeping any of these. They're all probably just going straight to Scammers wallets. They put the whole entire animal inside of a wallet. A dragon. Am I having good luck? I can't tell. I got that, that, and that, and that. All this was very, very, very expensive. Hey. All right. Yeah, take me away. Whatever. Dude drowned me in a river. I don't care anymore, all right? I'm going to have to give one more person a chance. I'm not losing my faith in humanity yet. ABC for trustee. ABC. She's scared me. What do you expect? Why do I always do this? I tried to trade this person, and they didn't accept me. They don't trust me enough to receive my items. They don't trust themselves. Dude, why is this guy saying ABC? What the he just stuffed me in this box. 
Stop it. Oh, this is a sad story. Please don't scam. This is my favorite. Then you just see a crying face. God. No, you first. No, you go first. All right, bro. Every single time I try to I try to get Scammed, they declined my trade. Man, look how depressed this dude looks at poor. Let's see if you're actually poor. All right. Yeah, you're you're really poor. No, wait. No, you're not poor. You got a money necklace. He spent all his money on this money necklace. No, I'm not giving you anything. I was literally just about to give him four Legendaries. But why are you just allowed to kidnap people? Hey, man, I'm about to change your life. Take that. You can have it. You could drink the whole thing, too, if you want. I hope he sees this video and he'll regret buying that money necklace forever. I just change your life. 
Say thank you. Thank you. I changed your life, right? King Cobra. He privately messaged me. Yeah, I don't know who you are, but take these. I really don't want them. It's probably one of the last times I ever played this game. There you go. Trust trade. Kill those pets. Just get rid of them for me. Well, guys, there's my adopt me experience. Maybe there's, like, a lot more kidnapping and theft than adopting and family role playing. Maybe they should change the name of the game to, like, maybe, like, Grant. See, this is why they should add guns. Because then they could just call it grand Theft auto. That guy didn't have a money. Necklace. Would have gotten all my pets. Every single one of them. You.

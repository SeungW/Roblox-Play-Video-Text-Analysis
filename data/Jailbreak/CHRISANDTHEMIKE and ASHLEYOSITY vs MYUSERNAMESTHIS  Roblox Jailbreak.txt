So today we're gonna be doing a special challenge here. Chris and the Mike and Ashley are going to try to arrest me. Yes. This is finally happening. Everyone like, you guys have been waiting, like, two, three years since Joe Brick came out for this. So, anyway, let's go ahead and go into the rules real quick. No exploiting. Everything else is fine. If either one of you arrest me, that's a point for you guys. If I rob a store successfully, that's the point for me. Whoever has the most points wins. And I can use anything except for exploits. So, are you guys ready? All right, in 30 seconds, you will be allowed to arrest me. This is to avoid, like, spawn camping and stuff, just to make it a little bit fair, because we all know how annoying it is when you followed out of jail with a bunch of campers behind you and sharing it happen. So do you know any of the strategies I use considering playing with a bunch of rich players and escaping them? Like arresting me? 
None at all. 
All right, so obviously both bikes are something I always use because it's ridiculously broken right now. Not sure if I made it so that you can or cannot see the trail, but let's get ourselves these three over here. Okay, these guns are good. 
Now, do you use the jet packs? 
I will neither confirm nor deny that. 
Okay. We're going to find out. 
Okay, I may or may not just got a flying machine. 
What is a flying machine? Is it a helicopter? A UFO? What is it? 
Yeah, by the way, you guys can come arrest me, but something that flies is all I'm going to say. 
Okay, we're in a four wheeled vehicle. Not cool. 
Bye bye. 
Bye at all. 
I see you guys also have a flying machine. And bye bye. 
Oh, my gosh. 
Remember, I said anything in jailbreak that is not involving exploits aloud. And missiles are not exploits. So yeah. 
Ashley, we need a flying machine immediately. 
Okay, I think this thing over here is available for robbery. Okay, come on. Let me rob. Please do not scam me. Okay, good. There's no scammy thing on this thing. Okay, so I see a red thing. 
Let's go rob ash, I'll meet you at the flying machine. 
Sounds good. 
Hello? It just gave me 400 cash and it literally scammed me. What the heck? Stupid train. Okay, but at least that's one robbery. One point for me. 
Dude, he got one point already. Ashley, why did you let him do that? 
Oh, me? Oh, I see. 
When there's two, we can blame each. 
Other back inside of a flying machine. Okay, but this door is open. 
Hey, hey. What kind of trick are you using over there? 
It is not an exploit. It is a regular glitch inside a jailbreak that out of the bath. Have not passion like freaking ages. 
Interesting. 
Okay, he said he's at some kind of store. Which store? Which store? 
Bake in which store may or may not cause a alarm. 
It's a bank. It's a bank. Ashley, go, go. Just run in. Just ignore it. We're going after user only something, by the way. Wait, he's not in here. It's not the bank, but we're arresting people. Oh, my gosh. 
What could it be? I'm just gonna yeet on out of here. This glitch is ridiculously broken. I might get there, like, the maximum amount of cash from this robbery probably. I don't know. 
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness. 
What would glitch? What would glitch? 
I don't even know any of these two points. 
Oh, man, ashley, we're losing really bad. 
I know. This is the worst. 
I mean, it's not that hard to spot a green bush on a black bike. 
Wait, there he is. Is that him? 
Yeah, that's him. 
Oh, my gosh. He's going so fast. 
I'm telling you, this thing is absolutely broken. 
That's crazy. I lost him. I don't even know where he went. 
All right, team, get over here. Hold up. Something just opened. Something just opened. I'm not sure this is a good idea if you guys even know the glitch to get into this place. 
But we don't know any glitches home. 
All right, well, I'm starting it anyway. 
J store. Okay. At least he's locked down somewhere so we know he's in there. We don't know. 
I may or may not have just oofed in the jewelry store. 
Oh, my goodness. 
He's going to spawn somewhere, right? 
I'm just going to just go through the wall and be like, surprise. 
Come out. Come out with your hands up. You're surrounded. 
Wait, you're a salad? You're a solid hair. Is that what you are right now? 
I mean, I might be a pile of leaves. And he's out. 
He's out. He's out. 
Yeah. 
Let's see. 
He's already oh, my gosh. 
What glitch is that? 
I have no serious day since day one. 
Oh, my gosh. 
How are we ever going to catch this guy? This is impossible. Look at it. Look how fast this is. It's insane. 
I'll go wait here for, like, 5 seconds. 
You got to count it. You got to count it. 
Oh, snap. Hold up, hold up. 
What is it? What is it? 
Whoa. 
Where did you go? Oh, my gosh. Get them loaded. 
I was trying to rock it, but they're like, but there's a cup behind me. No wonder I was getting slow down. 
Oh, my gosh. Ashley, you almost lost your life. 
Perfect. 
There was a random cop behind me that was slowing down. I was like, how is this slowing down so fast? There's no way one person slowed down that fast. There was this little random guy with the weirdest face ever right behind me. 
We could camp. You right. 
I mean, there's no rules now. What are you doing in Ocean? I'm innocent. What are you doing? 
Police officer in love and war. 
Why is this police officer trying to Oof me, man? 
Where are you? 
Sad? I have no idea where I am. I might be in Mad City. 
Oh, there he is. There he is. Bacon right there. I want the Tron bike slowed down based on what your house was. 
You realize that this vehicle tires are literally impossible to pop without some form of bike, man. 
Wait, he's going to the gun shop. This is it. This is our chance. This is our chance. 
All right, hold on. 
I've fallen. Okay, there we go. 
There we go. 
Steal his bike. Oh, it's locked. 
Even in our mobile garage, the missiles do friendly fire. You realize that, right? 
Wait, someone else is firing at us. Your friend. Oh, no. 
Good job. Thank you. 
Now's your chance. Speaking. 
Thank you, my fellow criminal. All right. 
Oh, my God. 
I got out. 
This is we are absolutely no match for this guy. 
This ran a bacon hair. That's not even a bacon hair right now. 
I'm glad we haven't ran into players this good on our regular videos. 
Okay, now it's dark and raining. You know what that means? Dark bolt bike. No one can see except I'm a green salad. 
What's your opinion on it being way too dark when it's raining? 
Rip people using crazy old monitors. Okay. 
Oh, my gosh. There you are. Hey, you. Wait, no, you're still in the truck. 
Is that me? 
No, it's not. 
Bye bye. 
I can't even see where he is. What is this book? 
Come on, come on, come on. Yes. Ootsie is so op right now. The utsi needs a nerve. 
I think so, too. We were getting erect by that yesterday. 
The Otsi, like all the rich players, use it. 
Okay. 
Every single rich players use the same three guns I use. 
Geez, so rich is considered 50 million and over. 
Yeah. 
Oh, my gosh. I'm 6 million away from being. 
Player has almost 700 million. 
That's insane. Okay, he's in I don't know what vehicle he's in on this, okay? 
But I literally cannot see anything regarding this robbery right now. It's so dark. 
He's dark. 
It's actually, like, impossible to see inside of this robbery. 
Is it the bank? 
I don't like robbing banks when there's a lot of police officers around. Did something just flat? 
Unfortunately, dude, that was the nuclear power plantation. We need to go get them. 
Where do you turn into money when you get that? 
I think it starts with a V. Am I correct? 
I mean, this vehicle is so fast, I think I might just go in and out super fast. 
No, you're not even eight. Is it you? 
No. He's ivy. He's Ivy. 
Oh, my gosh. All right. Oh, my gosh. 
Oh, my God. I'm stealing you with my mouth. That's how I'm able to get in, like, perfectly fine. 
That's crazy, man. 
Let's see if I can get the phone copper out of here. 
Let's try to get we're getting erected by your friend. 
Yes. 
All right. 
I'm just pushing all these helicopters away from here so you guys can't use them anymore. Bye bye. Helicopter. Come on, helicopter. 
Move. 
Okay, hold up. 
I've never seen jailbreak meta quite like this before. 
There's really, like, four criminals at this base. None of the criminals are at this place. I need a criminal here. 
Museum. Museum. 
Come on, criminal. Get up here. Get up here. Come on. Holdy. You got a holdy? Sir, I need you to holdy. Actually know the medium club. Let's go. Whoa. I'm so bad at your whoa, whoa. 
Whoa. Whoa. 
Whoa. Dude, the vault bike literally just pushed out. I went away and it came back like, what the heck? 
I see you. Come here. No, you're jetpacking away. No, you absolutely hate jetpackers. How dare you jetpack away? 
I'll show you something even better. 
There you go. 
Volt bike. 
Oh, my he spawned his bike mid air. Ashley went out and took off. 
Yes. Clothes thing. Abbott, why is bank clothes? 
You know, I wish I knew any exploit at all at this point. 
We need those cheats. Now I see why people cheat. 
Cheat. 
Hold up, hold up. I'm in. 
Wait. 
Bank somewhere, right? 
Museum. Museum. 
All right, we need a fire truck. We need a fire truck big time. 
Why does he need a fire truck? 
Fire truck is, like, ridiculously broken for a museum. 
He is in the museum. Okay. Can I use that? Can I use that thing with a rope? 
What thing with a rope? 
Is that a glitch or is that an exploit? What is that? 
I might have just swooped in the museum. 
Oh, I just watched you oof in the museum. Ask check the volcano. I'm going to go check city crimb base. 
Okay, we'll try to come over here. Vehicle is really pooptastic, but I think I'll have to use it. 
Is that him? Is that you, sir? Am I what? Right now? It's a camaro, right? 
Yeah, it's a craft tastic vehicle. That's all. Yeah. 
Where did you in the black Camaro ash. 
Not anymore. 
Oh, gosh. Wait. No. Yes, he is. Yes, he is. Wait, tesla. I think it's a Tesla. Yeah, it's a tele. No, it's not a UFO. 
No, a UFO is if you go on reverse fast enough. 
Okay, he's going to the gun store. He's going to the gun store. I repeat, he's inside of the gun shop. He's inside of these. 
I need one of these. All right, come on. 
Need one of these. No. Gun store. Good store. 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my gosh. We are actually getting rid of the total beast. 
Yes. One point ash and you got it. 
I need a key card. There we go. We got a key here. 
I might as well give you one. Baking from me. 
I got a free Volat bike. 
How dare you take my vote bike. 
I like you when people don't lock your vehicle. It's one of the best thing ever. 
It's so convenient. And I'm one of those people that never locks it. 
So you're basically a Creek craft at this point. 
Yeah, we're Creek crafting pretty hard right now. 
The bike just stopped moving. What the heck? Dang nabbit. This place just closed. I was going to rob it again. 
He was going to rob it, and it just closed. It was the J store. All right. 
I think this works. 
Finally. Okay. What color is your trail, buddy? 
He's in the bank. 
Bank. Oh, DA. Okay. 
I mean, he's outside the bank. Oh, no. He just stopped. 
I see him. He's going to get his Tron bike up here. How dare you? 
Oh, my goodness. 
I'll try to snipe. 
I think he switched straight up. Let me ask. I don't know. 
That's confusing. 
I arrested the wrong bush. 
Ellie, he's a cop. 
Go. 
There it is. 
Go, go, go. Wait. 
Let's go. Pick them up. He just jumped out. He just jumped out. He's going towards the vehicle. 
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. 
No, he got to wait. 
No. 
All right, he's going to the gun shop. 
Okay. 
He always wins in there. No, he's not going to the gun. No. I'm getting messled really bad. 
Come on. 
Shoot him. Shoot them down. Shoot them down. 
No. 
That was close. 
I'm scared. I'm scared. He must be following one of us. 
What if I am? 
He is. He literally is following us. Oh, my gosh. 
Don't do this. 
Orange following pink. Oh, my gosh. I'm getting missile to death. 
Bye bye. 
I've never had two military copters mislead me at the time. 
No, there's a random. There's a random right here. Random. So many random. Bacon airs. All right, you're gone. You're gone. You guys are all gone. All right, we need to rob the museum. We need to rob the museum. 
Come on. 
Hold E. Please hold e. All right, we got this random ant looking guy. He's gone. 
Top of the museum. 
The guy is literally missing everybody. We're all gone. 
I'm here. 
Which one Donut? 
Near Donut. 
No. 
Oh, my gosh. 
Ladies. 
Do you get points for killing us, too? 
No, Robbie. 
Yeah, that's good. 
He's still going. Come on, buddy. 
Thank you. 
No. 
He stole your trunk again. 
I watched him do it. Listen here, all you did was watch him. 
Well, this random bacon just got me. 
Oh, man. What? Someone random could get you opened on us. 
Yeah, there's three random camping at the museum. 
You better not pick them up. You better not pick them up. Sitting on the passenger side of a military copter. No. 
I didn't have my rocket launcher. I didn't have my rocket launcher, man. 
I don't know how that happened. It was an accident. 
Again, all the fires are gone. 
This just goes to show that Ashley is better than me. At. Don't break. 
I caught him when he was in the gun store. So he was busy. 
No, race back to the prison. Race back to the prison. It's our only chance. 
Do I need an airlift? 
I'm monitoring the sewer situation currently. 
Well, I'm out of here. 
Nobody's freaking got him in here. I just watched him tron bike away. 
What is your problem just watching him do all this. Get him so fast. 
If you blink, you missed it. 
Oh, I know. 
Jeez. 
Volt bike op. Please. Ask him a bad CC. 
Nerf, nerf, nerf, please. 
Oh, listen. I'm on the Volt bike. That must be why I'm getting him. 
Oh, that must be it. I never somebody's using a bit too. 
Many helicopters, I think. 
At the tunnel. At the tunnel. 
Okay. Train tunnel. 
Yeah. 
All right. 
There's a random over here. 
Yeah, there's a random here. 
Hello. Bye bye. Spaghetti, SpaghettiOs, SpaghettiOs, spaghetti. No. Oh, my goodness. 
Holy cow. I didn't have a jet pack that time. 
Oh, is that? 
There were three cops on me. 
That's the only way we could do it, man. 
So I guess that will go ahead and wrap it up here. I think, like, it ended up eatering, like a tie or with a one point difference. Like, I don't even know. We lost track of the points. But, yeah, either way, that was a pretty interesting experience. Boat bike definitely needs to be nerfed because, yeah, that thing's a little bit op. Probably something crazy.

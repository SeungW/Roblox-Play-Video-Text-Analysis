Come on. I got this. Oh, this is nice. This is so chill. This is so easy. I hate this. So easy. Such chill. So easy. Wait, there's a rage pass. Money. What's a rage pass? It's like a battle pass. This battle passes in this game. You said you were good at this game. I am good. Look, do you want me playing first person? 

Yeah, I feel like first person is a lot easier because please, you could just do this. It is easy. Can we get checkpoints? No checkpoints. Hey. Don't hear enough screaming? There is no screaming. Raging because there is no rage. I'm just vibing. I like this game. It's so chill. Nobody vibes at this game. You should thank me. I bought you the double checkpoint. Thank you. Thank you. Go. Thank you, Gold, for buying checkpoint. See? Draco's just waiting for us up there. Draco, what a kind brother you are. No, I'm trying to win. You guys, I made it to the blue level. Great, Rainbow. But no one is at the blue level. We're at this level now. Yeah, I'm very bad. Oh, my gosh. Luna just fell. Oh, gosh. Oh, I forgot to double flip. That's my fault. Wait, what's the next level like?

Just kidding. You start code funny and pat code. Goal. So easy. Hey, Draco. Where are you going? I need the bragging rights. There's only a minute. Get out of here. I'm speed. You know how many I was going to say like you know how many Aubies I've played in my lifetime? So many I can't even count. That's why yes, Rainbow, but how many times have you hurt? All the time. All the time I hurt. Exactly. 

Hurting. That's why you cannot make it this far. What this car? You need to get up there. Gold, there's a minute. Last star creator. Gold, can you buy another checkpoint? No. Is that a no? There is a checkpoint. Still mean. What? Wait. How do we do this part? You got to jump through the hoops. 50 seconds. Okay, watch this. No, I'm not making it. I'm making it. I'm making it easy. I got this. I just got to be chill. Yeah. Dracoina. No. Oh, how unfortunate. Did you didn't. Okay. It looks like funny and Dracore in a time. There's 20 seconds left. 20 seconds. I'll make it a little further than Draco. Get away from me. He already died. Who. 16 seconds will be victorious.

I need more coin. Yeah. Okay. I'll buy it. Tilt, Rainbow. We're going to win. Double jump. Double jump. Does invert colors help? It's so expensive. No. Do not invert the colors. Okay. Low gravity. There. Why? Low gravity is horrible. It lowers us. No, it's too late. We go. No. We go now. So many red lies. Low gravity is really horrible. No. You made this impossible. How does we have too much robots. Great. This is why. Don't cheat. Slow. 

You made this impossible. Okay. How are we going to get through the grid? Everyone. Can someone just make it through? Is this the worst pass in history? No. I got it. This sucks. I hate this. Delete. Delete should not have brought low gravity. I will not mess it up this time. Come on, checkpoint. I'm ready. And double jumps. There. No. I did it. I did it. Wow. Good job, Rainbow. Draco, can you not make sound effects when you jump? It's distracting. I blame you. We lost one. I think this is one that all of us can beat without raging. Guys, she's at the back. Stop. No rage. 

Okay. Gold just died for Kaz karma. Play intense music. I'm not talking. I'm not talking at all. I'm just going to run through this. Just like a speed runner. I am. Is this peaceful? Not peaceful. It's quiet. Hashtag get wrecked. Okay. So I got this. I just do this. Oh, I forgot. I have double jump. What am I doing? I paid for double jump and you forgot you got double jump. Yo, Draco. Can you, like, chill for, like, 3 seconds so I can catch up. Do it slip. It's slippery. Not chilling until she chills. Okay. Three, two, one. Stop. They're not stopping. They're not listening. Oh, you say stop. They outgrow. Hey, Dragon. Get your butt back here. Luna, you got to beat him. You got to beat him. I stopped for no one. The slope is very slippery. 

I don't know why I'm losing. Okay, this is dumb. I'm being dumb. Why am I losing? Okay, I got this. Rainbow, watch. The slope is very slippery. Who am I watching? Why would you tell me to watch? Why did you fall like that? Why would you fall like that? No. What is this game? Okay, never mind. This game is rage inducing. I'm getting annoyed. I'm getting so annoyed right now. I don't know how you guys pass the blue level. Blue is betraying me. Why would blue betray you? What? How? I just saw Buddy fall off. I'm going to fall off, too. Is blue actually easy? Because I feel so stupid. What? I'm pretty sure blue is icy. Oh, okay. It's not. It's just like a jump pad. Yeah, when you jump on the jump pad, you can't click the spacebar. Else you don't jump. Thank you. Yeah. Double jump. Let's go. Funny. Look up. Come on, me. Come on, rainbow. Rainbow, pleas for life. Let's go. 

This is easy, right? No, that's your fault. Left, right, left, right, left, right. Speed. Rainbow is nothing. What? Is Draco actually making it to the end? He wants those bragging rice. I'm at the end. No, Draco. Before you bragging rice will be mine. But before you finish the race, I want to tell you something I would just like to say. Oh, my goodness. No. Why are you so amazing at the game? Don't finish. Don't finish. I'm at the end. Funny. Don't finish. What funny? I'm taking advantage of the double jump. Drag was beating us. No, this was just round one, bro. I've already won through the hoops. Loop de loop. I hate this. Oh, my gosh. This is seriously did I make it? The fears will be the death of me. Oh, my gosh. What? Rainbow's past. No way. 

I'm not talking rainbow. Be fun, rainbow. Thank you. Wait. For you. For your support. Okay. Thank you, rainbow. You know what? Rainbow is the best. I won't betray you. Yeah. Let's give Bunny a round of applause. That was so sad. I just saw that. That wasn't I just I gave a kiss and I fell. Well, that was horrible. Let's see. We're not going to let that get to the end. Are you guys all at the end? Almost. Almost. They're saying it like they're so chill. Like, almost. I know. Just, like, walk in the park. What? You're still in red. You must suck then. Aubrey.

I'm not talking. I'm not talking. And I'm winning. Oh, jack was in the back. Odd. Well, I can't. It's hard for me not to talk. Says she doesn't talk. Still talking. 

I'm talking to annoy you. I hate this. Please, please. How do you jump on that gray platform? Hey, everyone. Welcome back to Crew News. Today, Gold is finally first in this aubby race. I suggest you stop. She is in her favorite land, banana World. You're making your own news channel. Remember, there's no checkpoint. Gold. True. Gold here in Crew News. We would just like to say that the latest drama is ensuing right now. Gold is in first place. Whoa. She's so pro what? Gold somehow has not died? How is that possible? That is newsworthy. Oh, hello, everyone. This is your best news drama channel. Funny. Rainbow, it works. It helps you win. Gold is in the lead and beating everyone at the aubby. Is she hacking? They both just lost. 

You jinxed me. But I will come back. What is this next level? We'll never know. Banana level easy. I hate this purple thing. I don't get it. Toxic raged. I hate purple. I feel like having double jump would help. Okay, we're just hating. Whoa. Hating on lunar's favorite color. Luna, get out of here. Dude. I hate blue now. I'm kidding. There's no blue level here, so I cannot hate blue. Let's go. No rage so far. Did I make it the furthest? Gold. Did I beat you? I lost at that part where no, I lost at the blue part, like, at the end. There is no blue or indigo. I don't know. Indigo? Stop messing me up. Don't talk to me. Speak to me. Wiggle. What color? What color? What color is your favorite color, though? 

Guys, like, seriously, out of all the colors, there are so many pretty colors in the world. But what is your most favorite color? Is it blue? Is it magenta? Am I annoying you yet? I like, colorless, colorless, color. I'm just saying, if I had to run away from monsters like this, I would never make it. So, apparently there's a no, that's gotta hurt. I wanted to annoy you guys. What? So, I wanted to talk about did you paint color? That is the darkest paint in the world. Yeah. No. It's, like, so pitch black that if you paint it, it will just look like the black abyss of nothing. You know what I mean? Wow. Yeah. Why aren't you doing that? We should buy that. We should buy that paint. Because I rage. Quit. Tell me more. Tell me. Why aren't you doing there's still time. There's 1 minute left. Gold. 1 minute left. 

Gold. No. Rainbows. Why is she there? This is hard. Make it in time. I can't. We have to buy checkpoint. Not going to make it. Jacqueline don't believe on rainbow. That was rude. I'm playing this. Yo. What if we do a challenge where we only face forward? So we face the camera this way and we play. Ready? Watch this. No, like, best luck. Al redemption round. It's back. There's no point of buying checkpoints here. It's just one way. Okay. Who has an annoying trail? How did you buy an annoying trail? Whoa. I think making those noises extremely annoying. 

That was so seriously toraco. You know how I usually call you annoying? Today? It is quite extraordinary that you are being extra, extra, extra. Hoopla. No. Hoopla. Hoopla. Wait, it works every time I say hoopla. Can I just take okay. Time to concentrate. I'm Vibe. I'm Vibing. Okay, Vibing. I'm Vibing. Hi. Can you shut up? So much angry. This game makes me angry. I'm frustrated. Rainbow, I don't want to be rude, but you're, like, you weren't even close. You can't rage. You weren't but, like, you didn't make it. Can we see? Checkpoints work here. Did you know they don't? No. You buy checkpoints. I'm not buying. No, you buy. 

You buy. There's someone rich here. No. I'm glad you asked. Draco. I buy Rainbow for the 8th. You have no robots. You have to stop. You must stop for being rich. Okay, that's epic. Thanks for sharing. And you broke the lobby. Good job. Yeah. Is anyone going to talk about how Gold is still in front? Whoa. What happened? What are you talking about? We've transcended minecraft. With a power of minecraft, I shall beat this jinky sewer level. This level got nothing on me. Oh, my gosh. I feel so powerful. I feel so much stronger as a block. I want to punch someone. There's. No. You're welcome. Didn't work. Sorry. I meant not punch someone. I meant punch. 

The sewer doesn't understand that we have that we're now all powerful humans. Yeah. No. I still suck. If you're powerful, then beat this. This rig did not help me at all. Everyone at aubbies and speed running. You should try this game. There was a dropper. Wait, there's a dropper? Yeah, if you go far enough. Oh, my gosh. I'm getting so pro flexing. Draco, shut. Like, if you go far enough bruh. Bruh. Wow. Look at Draco in front of me. So bad. Wow. Draco, why are you being bad? Lunar, what happened up there? I was at the dropper level, and I clicked the red thing and then I died. Do not click the red thing. You must touch the floor. Remember my word. AG. She can't even lunar, I don't even know what that means because I'll never remember my words. I will remember your words. 

She won't even have a chance to use your words. The point of this is to be chill. If you're not chill, you will never make it this far. Oh, I never stop. Hey. Don't chill. Draco, stop. Draco. Draco. Roll today, remember? Funny. The dropper. I'm remembering, but Draco is being quite annoying. Never chill. I'm concentrating. Hello, on radio station. I don't want to say it. Can't quite yet. Two minutes is still enough time. Fine. Follow my lead. Funny. I'll hold your hat. Never mind. Welcome to today's chill radio station. Today, we're just only listening to chill. Okay, time to vibe. Vibe. Vibe. 

You're saying vibe won't help? Vibe. Vibe. How can you vibe when you're in a toxic sewer? You're toxic. It's vibe. Play toxic music. All right, there's only a minute left now. I give up. See, in life, you can't be a giver upper. You have to be optimistic. Look at every situation. I hate this. I give up, too. Who cares? Who cares? There was no lesson here. The lesson is, if you're bad at Aubbies and Pakor, don't play this game. Or else this will happen to you. New map. Okay. Yes. Okay. Deep breath. I'll do that. I like your new look. Thanks. It's called Luck Bunny. All right. Is my jam okay? We bought. 

I thought you guys weren't buying double jump. No, I bought I didn't buy that. Wait, who brought it? I bought it. I'm bad. Why do you always buy this bad stuff? You don't need it. You need double jump. Without double jump, you can't fix your double jump. Doesn't even work half the time. What works for me? Give jacko these blocks. Funny. You have to inspect the map before you buy stuff. Does this look like you need double jump? Gold, stop talking. Every single you guys are talking to distract me because I'm in first. Why you are talking first place? No, no. You're talking to distract me. I'm in first place. Look at this. You're right. Double jump doesn't work. It's lame. Double jump is so lame. Yeah. Great. Now rainbows and she woo. Right? What type of noise is that? It's distracting me. 

Bro. Are you a duck of some sort? Are you a duck? No, dude. Are you a duck? You're the one make baby duck. It almost we're working. It's working. Please. Not how you do it, Rainbow. It's imagine if you were, like, game characters and game characters. We already passed this level before. I don't know why I'm struggling with it. Easy as pie. No. Funny. You can't bring me. I'm getting a speed coil. I'm gonna go. How are you getting what? A speeder getting speed. Dude, getting a Speed Coil is gonna mess you up, Draco. Not as in with the power of Wang. 

Oh, my gosh. You actually got to speak. But stop it. Dragon. No. No. Oh, my God. Draco. If you were going to make another alter ego, it would be Draco the Duck. Right. Draco says, hi. No, it's draco. Duck says what's the rush? Oh, now we should slow down, Mr. Coil Boy. Yes. Rainbow edge. This is good. So drop the first round, and I will win the second round. Go, Bur. Slow, but fast and steady. Rainbow. Rainbow. 

The problem here is rainbow, you're not embracing your inner chill. Rainbow, shut up. No. He's trying to mess me up. I'm making it to the end. There's nothing, no mistake whatsoever. Watch the smoothest, butteriest Speed Run coming in the history of Roblox. Speed Run. Just kidding. Behind. Get away. Somebody buy a speed coil? It's always the slopes that get me. Funny. Funny friends. My gosh. You always see me at every game. Dude, this ain't it. I'm seeing you this time. Shut up. If you have a joke, I'll stop. If you have a joke, I'll stop. 

Chill. Chill. You suck, Draco. I'm the true winner of this game. I am pro. What you think? You think I'm just come on, Draco. If you make it to the end, I'll race you. No. Speed Coil. Cheats. I'm not running. I'm not running. No speed. Coil teeth. I'm not cheating. Where are you? They're already cheating. You're already there. I'm not what are you doing? Get away from what have we learned today? We've learned that if you embrace your inner Duck, anything is possible. And Rainbow has lost her mind completely. She lost marble? Yes, she did.

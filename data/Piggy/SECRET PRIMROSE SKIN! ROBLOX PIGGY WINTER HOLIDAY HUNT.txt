Piggy book two. Winter holiday hunt. Oh, we got some new stuff for the roblox piggy. Winter holiday hunt. Let's go. You should probably have an alts or friend play as the piggy if you can, because having a piggy chasing you makes it that much harder. Okay. Refinery. We got to start a refinery. We're going to get the new skin first. It's all winter theme now. It's snowed outside. I know we're here to break your little girlfriend's dizzy out of here, but we're going to be breaking someone else out, okay? Okay. So first things first. We're going to get in here as normal, just as we normally would. Take that. Okay, give me the green key. The two main things that we need for this are the screwdriver and the gun, wherever they may be. 

BA, BA, BA. Open that up. What do we got? What do we got? What's over the it's been so long since I've played this map, I forgot. We got yeah. All right, let's make sure that doesn't happen again. Here we go. Find the hole. Hey, there's a screwdriver. That is, like, the biggest thing that we need. Let's bring it over here. Let's bring it over here. Let's open this up. And there's the gun. So the gun is right next to the screwdriver. We're going to leave them in here, because we're going to need them right on the other side of this door, and then that's how we're going to get the new skinny. Stop it. Come on. Leave me alone. I'm trying to get some new skin here. Oh, gosh. Okay, close the door. Okay. And through there. Okay. See, guys, this would be hard enough with another bot chasing me. Okay. Blue key. That's big. That is big. That is big. Get the blue key. Then we open that up. 

We open that up. Come out, come out. Okay. Going to go get the yellow key because we got to give pony the carrot. All right, we go use the yellow key. We go use the yo key right there. Come out, come out. Yeah, we got the carrot. Oh, that's not a carrot. Oh, okay. I guess it's just lagging, then. Okay. All right, so we got to bring this carrot to pune. Bring it puna to carragher. Pune loves a carat. I got pune. Screwdriver. Screwdriver. There's the screwdriver. Okay, so we're taking the screwdriver, and then we got to get on the other side of that door so we can open it up and grab the gun. All right, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Open up, open up, open up, open up. Open it up. Yes. Okay, so gun. I'm going to drop this here for now. Let's go over here. I think it's this door right here. Is it? Yeah. Hey, you. You're not a guard, right? Think you can get me out of here? They trapped me for stealing a donut a doughnut. 

That is a crime of the highest caliber. All right, guys, so we got someone on the other side of here. They're in there for stealing a doughnut. Let's see. Can I see them? Can I glitch through and see them? No, there's someone on the other side. Okay, we got to get him out of there. Let's get the gun because we have to shoot at the door first. Okay, I have no ammo, so where's the ammo? Where is any ammo around here? Okay, usually there's ammo in these two rooms here where Pony went through the vent. Where Pony Vented? Yeah, I knew he was looking at Sussex earlier. Get it? Because it's like, among us. Anybody still play among us? Whoa. My camera glitched. Wait, why did my camera glitch? Look, I can't zoom in or out. It just goes up and down. Camera mode default. Wait, why is my camera doing this? Okay, you know what? I have no idea. I can't zoom in or out. My camera just broke in the middle of this. 

Oh, yes, there's some ammo. There's some ammo. Give me the ammo. Okay, I got it. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. I wish I could zoom in. I hate this. Bam. Well, that didn't work at all. Maybe something else will help. What? Dang it. Shooting it. You didn't help. Oh, man. All right, so let's get the screwdriver, the actual thing that'll get them out of there. All right. All right, we got the screwdriver. There we go. There we go. Thanks. I hope you won't need this screwdriver. I'll leave you a little gift somewhere on my way out. Okay, so they're probably going to escape through the vents in there. I wish you could see it. I wish it opened and it showed, like, a little cutscene of them escaping through the vents. But anyway, guys, they left a little gift for us on their way out, so we got to go get it. We got to go get it. Let's see. All right, guys, so if your gift is not at the beginning, it's going to be right over here. Yep, I ran past it, like, three times. Click on the gift. 

Woo. And that should be it. I think I got a new skin. So how about a nice hug from the otter guy? Yeah, here we go. Let's see. Moment of truth. Moment of truth. Hey, Primrose, we got the new skin. Primrose the penguin. Oh, yeah. I still don't have the snowman trap, so let's go get it, guys. Let's go get it. Now, to get this trap, we got to go back on the new winter holiday map. All right, here we go. Here we go. Just give me ten minutes. Ten minutes. Oh, my gosh. That is so nice. Oh, my gosh. Guys, when it was five minutes, it was ridiculously hard. If you saw my last video, you see I failed because of the time it was really difficult. So first we got to go behind that little ice castle here. Let's get that big old snowball there. So all the way down here, past these cabins, I think, is where it's being built. Let's see. 

Let's see. Check it out. We're building a snowman. Whoo. Next part is going to be behind this building. We got to click on that. Let's go. Bam. I feel like I should be hurrying, even though I don't really have to. I'm just so used to running so fast on this map because I only had five minutes before. Okay, the next thing is going to be in the maze over here. Let's see, let's see. What do we got? What do we got? What do we got? Where is it? I think yeah, you see this right here? Boom. Okay, I think that's like the eyes for the snowman. All right, guys, the next thing that we need is going to be in here by the fire. See that? We got a little stick right there. Okay, guys, so now there's a tree in the front of these buildings. It's like, in between them. Okay. There's a half here's, the magic top half of Frosty. Frosty's coming left, I guess. All right, let's see what we got so far. Let's make sure it's working. Let's see, let's see. Oh, there it is. It's so cute. Little piggy snowman. He doesn't have a mouth, but he also doesn't have a nose. 

He needs the classic carrot nose. So let's go take Pony's gift. Let's go unwrap it, and let's use that carrot for a snowman. All right. A ride of red. There's a carrot. Give me that. Okay, okay. We got the carrot. We got the carrot. Yes. All right, we got the carrot. Guys, we're going to have to find something else to give Pony for Christmas this year. He's not getting this carrot. He's not getting this carrot. Let's go use it. Let's go use it. And I think this is the final thing. Yeah. Chaching. Okay, guys, did we get the new trap? Did we get the new trap? Yeah. Whoa. Snow piggy trap. Oh, yeah. We got it, guys. We got it. Well, guys, that is going to wrap it up for the Piggy Winter Holiday hunt.

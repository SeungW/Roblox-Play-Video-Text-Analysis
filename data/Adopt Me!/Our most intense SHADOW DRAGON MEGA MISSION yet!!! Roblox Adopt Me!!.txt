Oh, my gosh. Oh, man. Here we go, folks. Here we go. Come on. After all this server fails and getting in and out, I need this. I want this bad. Here we go. Two, one. You ready, Cam? Come on. Come on. Be sure to use Star Coat Soapo when you're buying robots. What's up, guys? It's Gammy and Mike from Dump Squad Gaming. Guys, today we are on our Mega mission once again to try to get every single dragon Mega. That's right, guys. We need shadows. You know where we're at. We've got every other dragon but the Shadow Mega. We need to make this happen. We're close. We are so close I can taste it. Nilly. So we're going to get into some flack servers and see what we can make happen. Make some trades. 
I have a good feeling. How about you, Cammy? Yeah, I think we're going to get something. Yeah, Cammy's feeling it. She is feeling it. Yeah, she is feeling the mic drop. All right, guys, if you haven't done so, please subscribe comments and like our videos, we appreciate your support. Annual Star Code. SOPO when buying Robucks, guys, that really helps us out. And thank you if you do. Rich server time, here I come. Whoa. OOH. Nice, Cam. You got a lot. There's a shadow already. Nice. You got it. I'll put the neon RTech diamond dragon. Come on, Cammy. No, it's my only Frost spirit. Well, I want more. Oh, I know. The frost furies are nice. Come on. Oh, they love oh, man. Come on. Put it up. Let me see. That's not a shadow dragon. Come on. Come on, Rapunzel. Yes. 
I'm going to do a frost dragon up there. I'm going to throw the frost up there, right? And then I'm going to throw a neon peacock. Neon Unicorn. Is this good? Oh, come on. This would be so good. I think that's a good offer, right? Yeah, that's a frost dragon. Full neon peacock. And a neon uni. Yeah. Maybe add liquor. Brendan, lunch. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Good idea. Good idea. Throw a trex in there. Ghost Bunny. No longer in game. Neon Sloth. Let me do that. And that'll throw a peacock and a flying potion. Boom. Come on, now. That's good. Rapunzel says they're thinking about it, guys. They're thinking. So I'm going to put two neon lunar oxes I got the frost dragon. Neon Peacock. Brand new neon unicorns. Neon Sloth. The farmag is pretty epic too, right, Cam? I'm gonna click accept. I'm clicking accept. See if that they'll work for them. All right? They said they want some time to think, so I'm gonna have to decline. All right, so I got into a new server here. 
Let's see what's going on. Trade me. I need shadows only say ABC if you truly have one, please. Truly only if you have one. Because my trades are precious and they get turned off. So I just really need to know come on, JD. 1234. Yeah, that's what I am talking about. What do you think about that? That's pretty fair, no? Yeah. Adds more. I don't know. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, that's really fair. I think that wow. Do I decline this and go over to India? It's hard to decline it, but I got to get there. Let's trade. Let's trade. Let's trade these. No, guys, my trades turned off again. They froze. I can't trade this person with the Neon. They want to trade, so I said trades failed again. 
Guys, please follow me. Only if you have a shadow. How many trades turn off when you don't even get requests? I trade people now. I'm not even taking requests, and it's freezing up. This has been so hard, guys. Cam still can't even get in. I joined, like, I did this on a hack where you go on a private server and then get in, and then we'll be honest. Get fully in. But I've been waiting here and just switching servers. It's horrible. We can't get in. Let's see if I can get in. Ah. Now I'm loading. Save. Now we're both loading save. All right, guys, I just got in finally to the server after hacking around and trying to get back in and letting Kami tried the same thing. Let's see if it works. Come on. Fingers crossed. She's got loading save. Loading save. No more loading save. I didn't want to buy. Yes. I got in. You got in. Yes. All right, cammy I just accidentally bought a royal carriage. Those are so expensive. I know. That's horrible. I just spent 1499 roebucks. 
Oh, my gosh. I totally did not want that. There we go. There's that one shadow. All right, let's see here, folks. Hello, hello. Here we go. Oh, man. Does she had it out. Put it up there. Come on. I'm going to start putting some stuff up. Yes, there's a neon. My goodness. All right, boom. I'm adding. I'm coming in. What can I put here? All right, focus. Boom. Okay. Mega mega. Mega metal ox. Mega neon snow owl. Should you go mega UNIGA uni. Yes. We need this so bad. Yes. I'll do an albino. That's so good, right? What do you think? I said that is really good, guys. And if you haven't checked out our latest Vlog video on Soap Spot Family, check it out. It was so fun. We did a Taco telepathy. Check it out. So fun. 
We're back doing some Vlogs, so stay tuned on that channel, smash that sub button. And on soap squad. Gaming and Soap Squad. Please get it. Cammy in. Come on. This is epic, guys. This is crazy sauce. This is crazy. Wait. Yes, it's very good offer, Cam. I think they want to oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Jam it's a P in the end. Three, two, one. Come on. Angie OMG. Angie OMG. Angie's EXO. Yes. A week. Yes. Yes. They went away. What they said sure. They said sure, and then changed their mind. Oh, man. I got to try again. That was so good. I am not going to give up. Where are you, Angie? Can't give up. I am trying. 
You again. It's right here. It's in our grass watch. My trades are off now. No, they already turned off after one. This is nuts. I can't stand it anymore. All right, Cam, you can do it. You can do it. Get the one. Get the one. I like owl better. I know. I might do it. Oh, they want a few days to think. I can't believe it. My trays are definitely off again. Guys, I am so sorry. This goes this way. Don't know what to say anymore, guys. I've tried to get it fixed. Just can't. That's a great offer. I mean, that's 12345 legendary neons and a Mega owl. They're, like, six. I mean, that's ridiculous offer. That is so good. And the Diamond Dragon, they said if I do, I'll probably regret it. No way. You're not going to regret that. You're going to get a mega owl. I'm dying, guys. I am dying right now. They said they aren't, like, trading it right now, but they said they're going to sing. 
Oh. So they're going to think about it. All right, camel. Well, they're thinking about it. Try to trade some of those other shadows in there, maybe, because we're going to need those. Technically a mega kit. Nice. There you go. Mega Kit. There you go. I like it. Who. The neon peacock. Yes. I think that's fair. Come on, Grace. All right, let's see what they say. What are they going to do? Come on, Grace. Blue. Put the checkmark maybe. What are they saying? Anything? Oh, they said add. I don't know. That's a lot. I don't know what else you would add. Just put some regular legendaries. Metal Locks is in a game. I think that's fair for one shadow. Guys, comment down below if you think this is fair. I think Cammy is paying very graciously here. That's not even a mega. I know. It's not even a neon. Yeah, that's a great offer. Come on. Like pink sugar is good. Yeah. Do you want to try the other one? Maybe the other person will like that offer. Yeah. Yes. Okay, come on. Here we go. And the frost dragon. 
I mean, that's already that's good. That's already good. I agree. Let's do a neon trex. What do you think? Games? Come on. I'll throw a Christmas egg in there, too. Sure. There are two rare eggs here, guys. Two rare eggs. Oh, my gosh, man. Here we go, folks. Here we go. Come on. After all this server fails and getting in and out. I need this. I want this bad. Here we go. Two, one. You ready, Cam? Come on. Come on. Yay. Oh, my God. We got it. We got another shadow in the Sofa Squad. That was oh, there's another one. This would be our neon. Neon. Metal Ox. Neon Peacock. Day strong. I will. I'm here. I'm focusing. Cam, no. Cam, I'm here. Neon snow owl. The Trex. Give me some music. Pooju poop. Trade more stuff. 
Where they say? Oh, I don't know. Lol. Oh, man. Okay. The neon uni. That's the best one. All right. Neon Uni. Oh, where'd they go? Come on. Yes. They were about to do it last night. Yes. I think I can get it. I can get it. I'm back at it, guys. I am back at this now. That's good. Yes. Give me this. Come on. They're not saying anything. They don't like metal or uni. Okay, okay, that's fine. I'll take it out. Come on, JD. Come on. I'm a huge fan. Where's JD? Thank you for being a fan. Thank you guys for watching. Make sure to check out all three of our channels. We're going to be crushing a lot of new videos, guys, so be ready. Put those post notifications on. I have a bad drag. In need of a shadow. Oh, man. Okay, I have to try to get this, then. Come on, Cammy. Get that bad dragon. Get it, get it, get it. All right, cam yeah, that'd be good. Oh, my gosh. Yes, Cammy. Oh, come on. Please, please, just do it. Please don't make us suffer. We don't want to suffer anymore. They wanted Cam to add, so Cam declined it, and she's going back in to make some ads because they went one check mark in. 
So you can't add after that check mark. There you go. Perfect. Yeah, that's a lot. There you go. I mean, you got the Mega Pink cat there just for as one. Like yes. So they said, take away the albino bat and add something different. Deal. How about a kitsune? Yeah, right? Sure. Let's do it. Do it, do it. Yes. Oh, come on. Yes. They did it. High five. High five. Cammy. Dragon. Guys, we are not doing well. It's failed for sure. There's no way that's going through. I am literally sad and crying inside. Yes. Tears falling down. Another failed trade. We have been recording you don't even know, guys. 
For how long? To try to make this happen, guys. And to make it happen for us and way more than that. It is ridiculous. Guys, we're going to have to end the video, unfortunately, because this is crazy. Cam, you did an epic job making that happen. I feel you made it happen. That could have been the last shadow to make the neon. Well, the positive note is we did get one shadow, so we are one step closer. We would have been right there, but, hey, it is what it is. Guys. Guys, we appreciate your support. Please subscribe comment and like our videos, guys. You're the best. We'll see you next time. Bye.

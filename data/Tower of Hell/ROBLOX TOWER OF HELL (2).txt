Hey, everyone, it's your friend Think noodles. And welcome back to Roblox, where today we are trying the hardest Roblox Abbey ever made, called the Tower of Hell. Now, before we get to it, guys, please do like the video if you want to see. Why is this going? The time going down so fast, I don't even know what's happening. Please do like the video if you want more Roblox on my channel. Let's see if we can get this thing up to 5000 likes. And also, guys, if you're buying Robucks, please do enter my creator code or star code. Noodles and let's get started. Now, I know I said Tower of Helen, people would be like, yo, that's a swear word, man. Well, it can be. Oh, jeez, you look I already felt wait, what just why did it okay, we'll start again. Can be if used in certain contexts, but in this context, it actually isn't shimmy flairball. If it were, Roblox would not allow that to be the name of the game. 
And also, like, if you think about it, right, when you're in church, they say that, right? You know, so, you know, there's heaven and there's hell, so you can you can say that. I just don't want to say it. Like, if I fall, I'd be like and then say that. Okay, that's bad. All right, so I got to jump a ho. Goodness. Here we go. Hoop. Well, that was terrible. So, yeah, this is a tough hobby, and I'm going to fail a lot, get frustrated a lot, and probably not succeed at all. But I haven't oofed yet, so that person just oofed. Oh, wait, should I go that way, then? Is it the same? It's the same, right? So it doesn't matter. Okay, here we go. There we go. Yeah. Okay, see, that's the oh, jeez, I can't see. Okay, so that's like, part of it is, like, you got to keep it's kind of like minecraft. Oh, jeez. Now I jump right onto that stupid bar. So, yeah, you just wow. Level 24. 
What level am I on? Zero. Yeah, some of the jumps and things are about momentum, right? So you want to just keep it moving like that? Like that, and then stop. There we go. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Hey, there we go. Okay, so yeah, that's a little bit better. I look more, like, experienced like that. Up, you idiot. Stop showing off. Oh, there's pro towers. Maybe I should do those. See, the other thing that Annoys Or is bothering me is this stupid timer, because I don't know how wait, let's look up. Oh, I can't look. Oh, I can't see anything right here. Let's look. Oh, dude, it's so far. There's, like, no chance I'm doing this right. Oh, I think I understand what the, like, two X and four X thing was. It's, like, based on how many people have beaten it so far? Probably. So, like, if it once one person beats it, maybe it speeds up to x two, and then when, like, three people beat it, then it goes to times four. I don't know. Okay, now we go. 
Don't walk the clothes, dude. Yeah. Spiked up examinable. Okay, the other thing is guys what? Okay, well, you can't go that way, so yeah. There are no checkpoints. How close can you get? What are you talking about? I hate that this is sort of like I mean, in some ways it's like getting over it with Bennett Foddy, but in roadblocks, except for getting over it, you could make a mistake and then sort of redeem yourself a little bit. Not necessarily go all the way to the bottom, but like this, it's like well, I mean, I guess I could technically land on fall down and land on a platform that I've already been to, but if you hit any of these yellow things, you just die instantly. Okay, let's try that. Oh, jeez, guys. Like a kangaroo, man. Okay, he went oh, you got to go. Oh, jeez. Are you kidding me? Oh, man. Oh, I've done it. 
I've done it. Scattered. Okay, I got no chance now. Oh, dude, I almost wait, what did I do here? I think I went the wrong way. Yeah, there was no oh, dude, dude, dude, dude, come on. Oh, dude. Oh, dude, come on. I'm not even sure no, come on. I'm doing so well. Dude, look at this. Come on. I'm up, I'm up. How do we get up from here? Do we just like eh? No, you've got to be wait, is it the same one or is it oh, no, it's randomized. What is that? What is that? What is a weird snakey block or something? All right, let's check this out. What on earth? What? How are we oh, no. Well, that is in a bad look at how many people keep failing on that thing, man. All right, so do you even land on it? Okay, there it is. It's it's stationary somewhat. I got best. Woo. I feel good, I feel good. 
I feel good. Let's go, guys. Come on. Oh, jeez, they got small. Yeah, that is not that bad, actually. Well, it's not shaking like it was. It's, like, spinning. These are really far apart. Oh, my what, bro, come on, man. No, they get bigger. They get bigger. They get bigger. Hey, I wish these were checkpoints, but I think that's okay. That red is really well hidden, dude. Oh, I don't like this at all. Oh, are all these tested to be sure you can actually do them? Because I ain't so sure on all of these. Okay, I made it. Okay, what do we got, hard boy? What are these, like, named like, are these named after other players? Okay, I'm watching you see this person? Okay, grab that. Okay, I'll try. Wait, I can't. Why can't I grab it? 
Okay, now what is that, like, a thing you could okay. Wee. All right, that's fun. Wait a second. We could hit that. Then what? Okay, how much? Oh, we're all, like, halfway up high. High. Do we have to go there and then oh, jeez. All right, here we go. No, I hit it, and I went too far. Oh, you know what? I should have been zooming out a little further. I think that might oh, no, that's a little bit too far. I think it helps just a little. Oh, no. Whoa. What happened to you? I mean, I've seen some noobs in my days, but that because I'm talking about the noob. Like the yellow and blue noob, I'm not saying that you're, like, not good at roadblocks. I can't see that person, but that is quite the look, I got to say. How are these people okay, I was going to say, how are these people so fast? And they actually make it every time. No. Oh, no. Look at this. It was the other people say say, I did it all on my own. 
Oh, jeez. Now this okay. If I did this okay, here we go. What are we doing? What are we doing? Oh, it's over here. Yeah, I'm lagging, too. I'm, like, really good at abbies, so it's the lag that's doing it, guys. Yeah. So much lag. Come on. What is this? Dude? Hold on. Okay. There. I made it. This is horrible. Oh, I hate this one, man. Dude. Okay. Maybe I need to get in closer or something. I don't know what the deal is. Oh, okay. Let's just walk along. I don't like what look at that new dude. What's he doing? Okay, so this little ladder thing we don't actually need to, like oh, we do. Okay. I was going to say we don't need a climate, but we do. Okay. No. Okay, sure. There you go. We'll just stand on the edge here. I'll wait for the screenshot. 
Go ahead. I'm also scared, so you're welcome. Okay, let's try not to screw this up. Okay, cool. So just a little bit. Just go slow. Just go slow. Okay. Look at you jumping over me and stuff. Dude, I made it. Yes. I have defeated the stupid rings. The what? The insult. This is super insulting. Can you go? Oh, dude. Okay, hold on. Okay. My headphones fell. Oh, dude. I didn't even notice this on the side. Let's go try you know what? I hate this one. This one's really hard. Let's try he eats fat baboon. Let's try the Tower of Hell. Promote. Okay. It's so much more peaceful over here, guys. So what? What? Oh, my okay, now what? Now what? Oh, well, there's that. Okay, starting again. I did all right. There. Okay, this okay, so let's see. 
Let's follow the noobs. Which way is the right way to go? Because nobody's going this way. Should I go this way? Oh, this is like, a little. Let's go. Oh, dude, what am I doing? Oh, yeah, let's do this. I want to do what they're doing. Yeah, like this. So that way I don't have to worry about going over those like I did it. All right, now what's everybody waiting for up here, huh? Okay. The agents escape. Why is oh, okay, we're waiting. Yeah, we're going. Let's go. Wait, what? Okay, here we go. Oh, no, dude. No. I didn't jump early enough. Stupid. So yeah. Whoa, look at that. That's a look. All right, I'll take a different route this time. So wait. Oh, you can just go on these bridges, and then what? What do I do here? Oh, because you can catch the bridges on the side. Like that. Okay, that one's not bad either. That's a really easy one. I like that one. Let's do more of those. Okay, so I'm going to go on the right hand side, and you got to jump early. Wait, how did you do that? Okay, here we go. 
Oh, no. Whoa. Okay. All right, here we go. Wait, why is it going down? It should be going up. What's? Oh, jeez, I'm very confused. Here. And jump. No, that's right there on the edge, man. Buddy, we got to, like okay, hold on. I can't see because of the stupid. Oh, look at this. Wait, am I getting up to level? Oh, what did I get? Oh, wait a SEC. Dude. What? No more kill parts. Wait, is it just increases your speed, reduces gravity. Does this last forever? So now wait, but I don't see anybody. Oh, do they have these things, or am I, like, the only noob using them? Did that one just kill that guy? You're not supposed to. Okay. I think you're just supposed to, like oh, I see. Okay, so we don't want to land on those. Okay, I got it. So how long does this gravity coil last? Does it last forever? Because that makes things a little bit dude. A little bit? No. Oh, my goodness. How did they do that? There was, like okay. 
A kill spot right there. Oh, what? How is it? Oh, he can change it. Whoa. Whoa. Dude, don't what are you oh, my goodness. What are you doing? How am I going to get on there? Oh, come on. I completely missed that. Here we go. We got a new one. Where do we go? Up? All right, there's always a clock. Okay, so we got spiked up. What do we got here? Let's see. Bob. Okay. Whoa. Okay, so that the gravity coil. Oh, man. I kind of wish I hadn't wasted it. It only so only lasts for that level, and then, man, that makes your purchase wow. A lot of people die. That makes your purchases become kind of worthless, because I don't even know how I got those coins or whatever. We have done this one, actually, and I did it again. I've done it again. Yes, I'm unstoppable. Okay, this guy's, like, truly unstoppable. Wow, I lost my headphones again. 
Hold on. All right, all right. Relax. Calm down, guys. I really think that this video I am not going to complete a single stupid level because I suck at Abbies, and this abbey is, like, the hardest ever made. Okay, I got it. Okay, now do they all move? Nope. Okay, and go. Okay. Holy cow. What is happening here? Okay, that was close, guys. Super close. Okay. Oh, come on. Why is this one so small? And why is it I did it. Yes. Bridges by scripturash. Script trash. That's what I'm going to call you. Script trash. Oh, dude, this is a hard jump. So we're supposed to go like this. Oh, dude, really? Dude, why am I so zoomed out? Yeah. Okay, get up close, but not too close. Okay, look at this guy. Look at this guy. Oh, yes. Wait, I'm at the top, you guys. 
Look, look, look right here. Look. I'm the highest person. Oh, for now. And then I'm a fault. And then hold on. Let's let's take another look see at this. Okay, these are really small, and they're very difficult to see because of the wall out. I went from best to worst, you guys. Oh, my goodness. What? Wait, where'd they go? Where that verse? Oh, my goodness. It's a new one. What even is that? Oh, wow. They got some moves, too. All right, let's just okay. Why? I can't even see where we got to go. What are you supposed to do here? Like, you just go I made it around that part anyway. Okay, come on. These are really close together, so it makes the jumping oh, I don't like this. Well, I can't no, guys, you're making as hard for me as hard enough as it is. Okay. Yeah. All right. Oh, no, not that. Holy hell. 
Okay. What? This is the worst. Yo, this obstacle is insane, man. Yo, I cannot I know you guys are good at this, but you're making me worse. I can't see anything, guys, like, stop in my face. No, I lost my that's the third time. I think that's a record for losing my headphones. Okay, I got it. I did it. Snake cola. The kid won. Okay, what kind of snake we talking about here? This. Oh, okay. This one is not oh, okay. I thought we're going to have to I thought we're going to oh, well, I actually don't no. Okay, wait. Where we at? Where are we at? Which way is it? Let's try this again. Oh, no, it's times two. No, dude, we got to go quick, man. Wow. How are you so much faster than me? Oh, go on. A little bit too fast. All right. Look at it. I like these long. Oh, come on. Times 16. 
What's that about, bro? Come on. No. Oh, yeah, I got 102. Yo, I guess there are like, so many good people that, like, come on, now. I was like, what's? Dragging them? Okay, there's, like, a little spinny thing here. Okay, whatever. This is not a spinny thing. Oh, my goodness. I almost missed it completely. Okay. Whoa. Wait. Oh, you got it? Why didn't I not? So you got to, like oh, this one. Now what? Oh, you got to jump on it again. Okay. And then you got to jump over to there. All right, jump. OOH, I almost missed. Okay, now what? Did I actually go up, or am I in the same spot as before? No. Why didn't you grab you idiots. Oh, my goodness. I remember the skin. This is Dan's original skid on Roblox. That's crazy. I had completely forgotten what that even looked like until now. Okay, get invincibility. Okay. Are you are you telling me to do that? What is which one is invincibility? Okay, 500. I think it lasts per round, and, like, 500. 
I don't think I'm ever getting there, so oh, wait. Why can't I wait? Do I have to have one of those gravity boosters to jump that high? Because, like, oh, my goodness. It doesn't seem like I can jump high enough, right? No. I keep bouncing off, though. Okay. Oh, man. This one's a really high jump, though. Yo. What? All of these? You have to sort of get a double jump out of it. Like, I give up. Ditto. Oh, jeez. I love it. All right, at least some of you guys. And let's see. Yeah, you said ditto, not spooky. One look at all the people at level zero. So a lot of people here are probably playing this for the very first time so they can suffer the pain along with me, at least. All right, we're going to give it one more round. Let's see how this one goes. Here we go. All right, where we going? Up here? We got the corner catch, though, and this sounds good. Wait, why can't I climb this? Oh, you don't even have to jump, right? You just walk up it. There we go. Cool. Oh, I love this one. This one's great. 
This is really good. I like this one a lot. What is that? Okay, then we climb up this. Okay. Oh, my okay, this is cool. I actually like this one there. I liked oh, no. What? Oh, this is going to be so hard with all the people because you can't really see. I love this one. This is my favorite obstacle in this entire game. One, because it's not that hard, but two, it's just, like it's cool. Like these little stupid jumps. Oh, wow. How did I do that? Okay, okay. Oh, I don't like this, but I made it. Slippery snake. Here we go. I don't like not being able to zoom out and see. Oh, this thing remember, we played it, like, a little oh, okay. Yo, you guys got to stop that I was going to say, remember it was, like, shaking before? Yeah. Hey, I got 50. What do I do with that? If I just wait here, does that mean I get to keep the 50 or oh, my goodness. Yo, be careful, bro. So, like, the left half of these blocks is bad, dude, it's all blending in, too, which I don't. 
Wait, don't okay, my hand's sweating. Get out of here. He's going to do I jump here? Yeah. Okay. I wasn't sure if I should jump there or if I should have. Oh, now it switches. Oh, this sucks. Okay. What? It goes back and forth. This is horrible. I mean, at least it makes it somewhat obvious. Hup, don't go too far. I don't like this. Yo, look how high I am. Yo, this is the highest I've ever gotten. Okay. Doesn't mean I'm going to beat it. Get to the tail. Get to the tail. I get it. Look how high I'm 88. So does that mean I actually get those, or do I have to stay up here? What have we got? We've done this. Okay. We've done this. We can do this. All right. No pressure. There's tons of pressure. Who am I kidding? But it has been done. It has been done before. It is possible. Except my hands are sweaty. Like I'm shaking. There we go. Okay, now this is oh, yeah, this is the last one. Okay. 
I don't like this yo. Okay, hold on. Draw my hands. Unstable pathway. What does that exactly mean? Wait a second, guys, if I can get oh, no. I know. Okay. I would say, like okay. All right. What? What is this, dude? What even okay. Yeah, you do it, do it, do it, do it. All right. You show me. Okay. This dude is, like, jumping, like, backwards and stuff because he's, like, a maniac. Oh, dude, I don't like this. These are so bad, dude. Guys, I'm like my heart is actually beating fast. If I had a heart rate monitor, my heart rate would be so incredibly high right now. Where am I? Okay, I'm up pretty high. Oh, dude, this is a long jump. What? Did I just do it? Did I just do it? Yo, I'd be one. Oh, this guy. I'm not making any jumps, bro. 
We did it. Yo, do we go out? What do we do? Do we go through? Yeah. Okay. What did it do? I can't. Oh, okay. That's what it increases it to four. Yes. Yes. I did it. I actually did it. I beat the Tower of Hell. Made it all the way to heaven in the Tower of Hell. Let's see what happens. Do I get those? Yes. I'm done. I'm cutting it right here. End of video. End of video. I won. I'm not even going to try. Yes. Using Starco noodles that you can buy a roebucks. That is correct. Oh, guys, I need to take a break. My hands are shaking. My palms are sweaty. I can't believe I did it. I didn't think it was possible. There you go, guys. It is possible. Wait, did I get level one? Yes, I'm now level one. 
One skill point. Wait a minute. What do we got for wait effects? Is that wait, what are skill points? I don't what is it? What do you use the skill points for, man? Oh, what is this? Dude, I don't want to use them, but oh, look. Increase it reduces gravity, yo. So these are permanent upgrades, right? Increases speed, increases size. Whoa. So this makes things a lot easier, right? I think I would use so I just used it. So now if you guys want me to play this some more and unlock some more upgrades and ability so someone's got, like, 100, there's a reason they can zoom through it. Well, also because they're good at it. But if you guys want to play it, let me know by clicking the like button. Also, if you're new here, subscribe for more videos like this.

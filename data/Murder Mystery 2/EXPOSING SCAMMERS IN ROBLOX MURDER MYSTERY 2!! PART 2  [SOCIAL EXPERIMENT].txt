So yeah, guys, in this video I'm going to be the biggest new but known to humankind. And I'm going to have one of the best weapons in the entire game. Game. It is going to be super good. Everyone's going to want it. So yeah, I'm a level five noob with a chroma godly and we're going to see how many people are going to try and scam me to get that chroma godly. The weapon that we'll be using today is the wonderful Chroma Dark Bringer Godly right here. So the Chroma Dark Bringer is currently worth hold on, let me check the value list. The Chroma Dark Bringer is currently worth 5500 Sears. Man, remember when chromas were good? I mean, don't get me wrong, 5500 Sears is still a lot, but like chromas were a lot better a while ago. And this used to be like 25,000 Sears, which 5500 is still a lot, but just not as much as it used to be. 
But regardless, this is still a pretty good chroma Godly. So we're going to hop into some servers and see if people are going to try and scam me. I'm going to give myself a couple more things just to make this a little bit more believable. So yeah guys, we're just going to hop in a server with this Chroma Darkbringer and we're just going to see what happens.

And one more thing guys, don't forget to use Star Code Purple when you are buying Robucks and Roblox premium. It really helps me out to continue making these videos. So don't forget to use Star Code Purple. It's a pretty easy star code. It is literally just the color purple. So yeah. Anyway guys, let's hop into a server and see what we can do. But yeah, I'm just going to casually walk around with this Chroma Darkbringer. If anyone asks how I got it, I'm going to say that I unboxed it. I feel like that's kind of believable. 
I'm just the luckiest noob on the planet. Me want Roebuck. I didn't even mean to type that, but I'm going to take it. Dude, what even is this chat? I'm really confused. I'm going to really commit to the role of a noob. Like I'm going to walk into walls and stuff and just pretend to be the nubiest player possible. I'll never be having any godly or check it. This guy is just speaking the language of the gods. Dude, I don't understand me. Unbox godly. I got a godly today. Oh, okay. I will be very sad. Now I feel bad. I don't want to brag to him or anything. I'm kind of just acknowledging that I have a chroma in hopes that someone's going to try to scam me. So far, people just don't care. Do people care about chromas anymore? Like, is that a thing? Should I have eternal four or something? I'm going to talk to the pro here. You pro. Yo, she has a purple seat. Oh, okay. She left. I was about to say she's a woman of culture. She had a purple seer? Yeah, you have one because you're lucky. I mean, you're not wrong. Nice. Nice. What? Thanks so much. 
It means a lot. Oh, this this is a nice person. I have a godly on an oh, she's asking to trade. Oh, please don't try and scam me. You were so nice to me. A dark bringer. That's what for you're a godly. So I'm trading a chroma darkbringer. You're trading a normal dark bringer? Swear to God, if you say that this is a good trade all right, she's accepting. Is this good trade? Please don't say yes. No. She said yes. She said yes. Yeah, I think no. You definitely know that a chroma is better. Oh, but do you want to trade? I don't know. It's your choice. R and R godly is the same. If you like your gun, then you can keep it. Same name. I'm not sure. I'm going to be honest. I really doubt that you are not sure. I mean, innocent until proven guilty. So it's like we can both play dumb. We can both play dumb, and we can't point fingers at each other here. Yes. I like colors. I like the red. Can I trade you for the colors one? It's okay if you say no. I have red. I mean, again, innocent until proven guilty. 
But you you are shady. I'm sorry. You are shady. You're what? Prestige seven. And you don't know the value of a chroma. What makes colors different? I don't know, but can I have it, please? Dude, she's so desperate. She is so desperate for it. I will give you red because you like red. Dude, look at how hard she's trying to get you can't say that. She does not know that this is a chroma. Sadly, I can't talk to her now because I'm dead. What's your main account? Because I feel like this is an altogether. Oh, she's onto me. And you know what? I'm on to you. You may be scamming. I don't know. Yeah, we're going to have to dip with the server soon because she's onto me. Oh, my God. Murderer just killed her. So I can continue the conversation. That's the one thing I don't like about murder mystery, is like, I can't continue this conversation. Oh, she's dead. She reset. Look at how hard she is trying to get this done. I thought you were no, because you were pro. Can I get colors, please? She's trying so hard. It's my dreams. You have color one? I really don't know. 
I unboxed this. I don't know. Does she believe me? I think she's on to me. I think there are the same value. No. I'll give you another knife, too. You are so I can't with this game anymore. It was so nice to me. How could you, Beans? How could you end to see her? I I swear she's playing dumb. You get two. Godly, the way she's talking, I can't. But why you give too? Because it's my dream to have colors. It's my favorite. I think you deserve too. Nice, dude. She's playing so kind. Like, she's saying such nice things to try and convince me. Oh, thanks. You're really nice. So do you want to trade or no? I'm going to leave. Honestly, I have nothing else to say with that exchange. So that was an experience. I mean, again, I can't definitively say that she was a scammer, but just the way she was talking is just a bit manipulative. I don't know. You ever meet someone who just the vibes they're given off are just very negative vibes. 
That was me with that person. Godly. Me. Godly. Okay. I love her reaction. She's just genuinely uncomfortable. And there's the murderer. Well, that's the end of that. Oh, okay. I'm starting to question the murder mystery two community more and more as I continue this series. This girl's out here calling people bots. Oh, my God. I got to mess with her. Me. No bot. I have godly. Oh. All right. This girl's trading, and I died. That's wonderful. A seer. What for? She might be alive, so it might be hard to trade. You're going to accept this, aren't you? I'm going to have a little conversation with this person. Good trade. I didn't even ask. I didn't even ask. She said it's a good trade. Same rarity. Oh, my God. I didn't even ask. And she's just like, yep, that's the good trade. And you're out. You're calling people bots? I can't with this community, dude. I didn't even ask because she's still alive. Is she teaming? I swear she's teaming. She's still sending me a trade request. 
She is so determined to get this trade. I got my eye on you. There are so many red flags of this girl being a scammer. Right here is good trade. Yes. All right, what can I do to mess with her? How to get seer? I'm new. Can't get it anymore. Oh, my God. Big liar right here. Big liar. You can clearly get a seer in the crafting. Let's do it. Why does mine say chroma? What is chroma? Mine is rarer, but I want yours more. Oh, my God. Yeah. 100% a scammer. Proven guilty. Big liar. She says that sear is unobtainable. Really? Yes. She's committing to it. She's really committing to it? I don't know. Mine is pretty colors, but I like the green. Come on, let's do it. That's my dream gun. Godly. Forgotten how to get Chroma Dark. I'm going to ask other people what it's worth. And I'm going to see if the rest of the chat can expose this scammer. It says Seer is in crafting. She doesn't know what to say. She's not saying anything. I thought you can't get anymore, but you need a bunch of reds to get the green and it's very hard. 
Okay, but that doesn't excuse how you just lied. It'd be easier to get mine instead. But you said you can't get what you mean. No, you were on camera. I remember what you said. It is documented, ma'am. Is chroma darkbringer? Good. I'll add more knives if you want. Shut up. You're a scammer. Oh, my gosh. Was the murderer. The irony. The irony of it all. I was sure if she was murderer. Of course. David. See? Go on, I'm listening. Knife is better. Oh, of course. Yeah. Not a chromosome, a normal, average, everyday. Seer, the worst golly in the game is a knife. So it's totally better than the best gun in the game. The chroma darkbringer. Of course. That just makes so much sense. 100% a scammer right here. She was mean. She was calling people bots. And she's thinking of every single excuse for me to do this trade. Oh, Godly. Forgotten it's equal. Oh, this is a knife, so it's better. 
Oh, this knife is unobtainable, so it's hard to get literally every excuse in the book for me to hit the accept button. Is chroma darkbringer? Good. Knife is better. Anyway, she's trying so hard. No lol. It's literally the best gun in the game. Actually, I think Chroma Lightbringer is equal to it now, but I'm pretty sure Dartbringer still has better demand. I just want it because it's my fave gun. How to get chroma darkbringer. Not that it's rare. You can't. What? Yes, you can. You can unbox it. Hell, this man. It isn't rare. Yeah. You want to join her? You want to join her in this episode of exposing scammers? Hold on, hold on. Where's your friend? Let's put her on blast too. Dab. It's not rare. Yeah, yeah. Oh, is sear better? Say yes. And you're involved in this too? Oh, my God. And you. Oh, my God. This server is full of scammers. We've hit the jackpot, ladies and gentlemen. But it's hard to get. Seer is hard or chroma? Both are good. This server is full of scammers. Everyone is working together to make sure that this girl gets a Chroma Darkbringer. You are exposed. 
You are exposed. You are exposed. All of you are getting exposed right now. Want to do it or not? See her is better. I don't know. You're getting the better option because knives are better, right, Zoe? Oh, yeah, yeah. Get her involved. Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a group of scammers right here. All four of them. They're all in on it. I can't believe it. I can't believe that this is the server that we're in right now. We have really hit the jackpot. Ladies and gentlemen, there's a group of friends trying to get this Chroma Darkbringer. Oh, did you just try to shoot me? Excuse me. What are you doing? Why did you shoot in my direction? Oh, my God. You're the murderer. Okay, you're all teaming. Hold on. I will survive. I will survive. I will survive. Oh, my God. Survive. Survive. Survive. Yes. I survived. Yes. Me win, you lose. Dad, let's do the trade. How do people know values? I got to find a way to expose all of them. 
It's obvious. Okay, say value list. Say value list. It's by color. Both of ours are purple. They're pink. The ancient is the purple tier. I watch JD. They have value list vid. I'm going to check that. Now she's going to cover it up and say it's inaccurate. I'm going to stay AFK for like, a couple of seconds. I got to go. Yeah, run away. Run away. Hurry up and make your choice. Okay, it says that sear is worth one and Chroma Darkbringer is 5000. Seer, you will never get this choice again. No, I definitely will. I dare you to cover it up and say the virus is inaccurate. Do it in front of my face, man. Just get the seer. They're all in on it. They are all in on it tonight. It says chroma is better. Are you scamming me? I'm just going to mess with them now. Like, I don't care. They've already been exposed. No law. We all said that sear is better. Oh, of course. Mob mentality, huh? Exactly. I'm sorry. Me nube. You either want it or not. Simple. I unbox chroma. I don't know what it's worth. Okay, I will do it. I'm going to mess with her so much. 
Dude, you can't unbox to see her, though. I'm going to wait for her to accept. I'm going to give it like a good 10 seconds. Just waiting. Just waiting for it. She has so much hope right now. I'm about to crush it. I'm going to decline. Sorry. The pizza is here. Goodbye. Oh, my God. That server had so many scammers. God bless Roblox. Dude, I swear to God. We found the goal of mind of scammers tonight. All right, guys, I'm going to do one more server just for the heck of it. I feel like I usually do at least two servers, but, man, I don't think you can top that. We found four scammers plotting with each other to get my chroma, saying that Seer was better. Of all Godlies, the worst Godly in the game. Just normal, average everyday seer? I'm going to try and find one more scammer, but I don't think we can top that. Give me. Okay, this man is really aggressive. Okay, image. Do you want to trade? Yes. Okay, cool. All right. 
What are you going to put down? Bioblade. I can buy that super quickly. Blue elite Xbox. That is a cool godly. All right, so we have a trade right here. I'm going to ask if it's a good trade. Is this a good trade? Is he still alive? Trade cool godly for your godly. I don't know. You don't know? Are you sure you don't know? Because you are really desperate to get your hands on this chroma. You would test her. What? No, I just unboxed it. I unbox. You have a different account. I never know what to do in this situation. I'm going to respond to this by saying Roebucks just no context at all. Just going to say Roebucks, trade is good. Trade dark. How to get dark act. How do you talk to somebody else? I don't know where this conversation has gone, but I think he's on to me. Get lucky in a box. Trade dark. I unbox case and I got godly. This conversation has gone nowhere. You can trade dark. Can you say more than one sentence? Because that's kind of my thing is on the new put dark in. Okay, I'll do that except I don't know if I want to. He's so desperate to get it. You like my godly, right? It's an okay godly. 
I think I might have him fooled again. I think he actually believes me. It's a test. It I don't know what to say man. I like your godly looks cool. Oh, we have another customer. Thanks. I unbox it. Oh, nice. Is my godly good? Yeah, I know what worth. You want to trade? Okay, I got to give him like false hopes that I actually thinks it's not an alt. Is CER better? How do you feel? What? Why are you invisible? Why are you invisible? I have so many questions. Hold on. Stop the video. Why are you invisible? Yeah, I see this, right? He is literally invisible. Like I see his knife in his radio, but if he didn't have those, he'd be completely invisible. I can give you and teach you if you trade. Yeah, that's a scammer right there. You just exposed yourself. Congratulations. So hold on, this guy has invisible hacks and if I give him my Chroma, he will give me the invisible hacks? Is that what he is saying? I got to spectate this dude. He's literally invisible. I mean, he has the radio so it doesn't do much, but still. What's next is he got a no clip out of the map. 
How to invisible. Oh, and he's back to his normal self again. Trade four. Why you have chroma dark bringer. I unboxed it today. Okay, so if I give you chroma, you will tell me how to be inviz put dark bro. Do it. He's so frustrated. I love it. I'm pretty sure you either hacked or bought. It highly unlikely from your appearance, but, hey, you never know. They're really teaming, huh? This is the game that we're playing can't with these teamers. Dude, stop ruining the game. Is bioblade for my chrome darkbringer a good trade. Of course. Yeah. Oh, my God. They're coming in groups. Dude, they're coming in groups. Yes. I'm ordering. All right, cool. I can just chill with the dude, that's not a fair trade. Yo, the actual honest person out here. I see you. It's not a fair trade. Don't do it, man. Everyone said yes. Kid, this person says the trade is bad. Because it is, and the lobby says it's good. How do I know you will teach me how to be in Viz? I will. What if you are scam? I love how everyone's crowding me. Dude, this is so funny. I can show you. I am not. You have already proven to me that you are a Scammer. Oh, my God. Are you trading with your friend to sound legit?

I almost got scammed. Oh, man. Murder mystery too is something else. I think I actually did convince him that this isn't an alt, which I'm proud of. I'm sorry, Gabby, but it was payback for what you have done to me previously. It had to be done. I'm just joking. Your Dark is way better than my bio. Oh, my God. You're backing out on it. Nah, nah. Too late. You ain't joking. You were trying to get my stuff. Dude, this guy and all of his friends are a Scammer. Case closed.

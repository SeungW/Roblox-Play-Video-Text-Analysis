Now we need to play this game properly. We need to play more serious. Whoever is the murderer, raise your hand. I'm raising it, but you can't see. Okay, we're going to go shoot Rainbow.

Okay, we're in the alert room. I don't want to be in here. Actually, maybe the blonde girl won't see us in here. Okay, Luna, I'm checking both ways. Let's make it out of this facility. It looks like Rainbow has fainted over there on the floor. Blown pizza. I see you following us. Wow, we are really no stuff on that. Lunar, be careful. We got to run. She really does not like us at this point. She's just like, we're ridiculous. 
Sheriff. Sheriff. Ride. Oh, no. Lunar, ride. He's going to stop. Luna, did we die? Did we live? I think she ran out of time where she left me. Die, innocent swind. Okay, the sheriff finally shot Blonde pizza girl. Sher face. Look at her face. She's like she murdered all of us. Good job, blonde pizza girl. You did good. Tag a girl. All right, let's go select the map. And can we buy another chest? How many monies do we got? Oh, we could actually buy another chest. And let's vote for the what did you vote for, Draco? I don't know. He does not know. Knife box. Oh, I really want the crypto. Let's try it. Unbox this, please. Cheese. Oh, there's a cheese knife, too. We have an eight bit knife. A low quality knife. Nothing better than that. That is amazing. Okay, let's go, honey bunny. There's a bob on his back. There's a bob on dragons back. There's a bob on your back. 
I'm shape. I can't die. It was a bob on my bathroom. Oh, dude. It was just a troll. It was just a troll. What was that? That's not funny. Prank was did you just get pranked? That is no funny. What did you did you do it? I'm pretty sure that girl up there is the one who put the bomb on your back. I mean, look at all of her stuff. She has safe. We were just talking about admiring the beauty, and you came out nowhere, and you cut Draco in the trail. Cut me? Why did you cut him? Is it because he's looking super festive? Lunar? Because I like gingerbread cookies. That's right. You hurt. She doesn't like gingerbread cookies. 
Wait, do you actually not like gingerbread cookies? Are you just saying they're out of so you could hurt Draco? Let's actually vote for oh, no. Hey, is it me or these lobbies got way faster. They're just like schwoop. Who wants a delicious chocolate vanilla ice cream? Would you like one? Okay, everybody, who wants a free ice cream? You can come into the garage for a free ice cream. No. Yes. That's right. It wasn't free after. Okay, this guy's making me look really suspicious. You know what? Dirt. Dirt Batman. Boom. Okay, so it looks like everyone knows I'm the murderer. At least I can still enjoy some ice cream in the kitchen as a murder. Batman, why are you so lucky today? Why are you getting so much murder? Honestly? Oh, maybe it's because I bought elite rank. OOH. This whole time, I just see murderer. 
Hey, why are you hiding? Boom. Wow, I'm being so good at murderer. Is anyone in the living room fireplace. Oh, it looks like there's footsteps leading somewhere. Is someone in the bedroom? Seriously, there's no one here. I could chuck. Oh, no. The sheriff sees me. Sheriff, would you like some ice cream, dude? Oh, wait. I'm going to make them miss. I'm going to make them miss. We're going to go left to right. Always zigzag. That's the trick to being the best murderer ever. Best murder. Boom. Down. Okay, let's chuck this. Boom. Lunar, grab the knife. I mean, come on, grab the gun. Meet this. Meet my sword. Do you want ice cream? Here, look, it's just ice cream. It's just kidding. It's a knife. Here. I'm not impressed by your nerve, buddy. I have ice cream. 
I have ice cream. This guy's really freaking out. I have ice cream. You know what? He's trying to head for the gun, but we're not going to. Oh, I just threw the nap. Boom. Boom. Chaplam chaplam. Oh, yeah. We did it, guys. I'll win. Draco, is there presents under here? Gold for days or no, no. This chimney is actually just really dirty. This is just a very poorly made chimney. Oh, hi, Luna. We're just eating some ice cream downstairs. You have chocolate? Yeah, I got chocolate milk. You want my chocolate bill? No, thank you. Would you like some? Totally not licked. Ice cream. That is disgusting. Funny's. The murderer. I pat you anyway. Good point. 100% she's. Murderer. If I was the murderer, I would have killed Draco down there. You know me. I'm so fast. Pew, pew. Yeah. Okay, who next? I don't think you should hold that gun everywhere. 
I feel like the murderers. Shoot him lunar. Shoot him. Come on. The barbecue. Oh, man, this dude's really bad at it. Get him. Go. Let him shoot. Oh, no. You're failing so hard. You did it, though. Oh, Luna, you just shot it into the head. This isn't looking good. Even the ice cream running away. Luna's death. Why did he not kill you? No. Okay, so he was just following Lunar in the back. All right, I don't know why you would do that, but Ben, that is okay, everyone head outside. I will protect you. Out. I'm the protector of this town. You're the sheriff funny. You're the sheriff? Yes, I'm Sheriff Funny. 
Draco, are you in? Oh, yes. No, he's not okay. What is wrong with you? Why would you hurt me? I should have shot is an evil. Evil. That's what you have to say? That you oh, no. She even threw gold down there. Made her pose in a weird position. You got it, rainbow, if you're standing wow, that was a very quick game, Funny. Look at my dodge knife. I just got it. Wow. That is the most beautiful knife. I wish I could get a DOJ knife, but I won't. Forever be nope. I have to buy another common box. All right, unlock, please give me I don't want a red knife. But I have the red knife. Well, that's a basic knife. 
Okay, I'm going to wash my hands and dry them because I'm innocent. That's a clean knife. You're in a hospital. I just push gold on the floor. I know that some of us you murdered her, Draco. Get out of here. This is the whammin's wash. She's the man. Let's try the Whaman's washroom. The murderer would obviously like to murder us in a tight space, so we should go in them open. You know, maybe out here where the vending machine is, we can get some chocolate bars or some admire. This basic painting of Roblox. So beautiful. The old Roblox logo. Or we could all come to an agreement that Rainbow was holding a knife. No, girl was. The great part again. She's right there. She's right there. Rainbow legit was holding a knife. I saw. No, it was her knife. She's holding it. Look, she's chopping people. 
Who? Who was it? Who's? Her? Wait. Who was it? It was a girl with a great cardigan. HS JK Jack. Oh, yes, girl. She left. I'm sick of being murdered.

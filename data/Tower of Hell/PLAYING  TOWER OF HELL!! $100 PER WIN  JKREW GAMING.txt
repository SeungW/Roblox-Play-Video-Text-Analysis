What's going on, Jake? Who. Game words. Welcome back to our channel. If you're new here, I'm Silla. And I'm mad. And today we're playing Roblox. And in Roblox we are playing the tower of hell. But it's a little challenge, so there will be four rounds and whoever wins any of the towers and gets to the top will get $100. Maddie wins, she gets $100, and whoever has the most $100 by the end of the whole entire challenge gets chocolate. And this was inspired by the Norris nuts. So before we get started, make sure you smash subscribe if you part of the Jake crew giver squad. Also give this video a big thumbs up. Don't forget to hit that notification bell. So you notified. Post new videos just like these ones. So let's get started. All right, so it's round one. Let's see here. This one's easy. This is the best. Probably if I thought I'd be so mad because how many coins do you have, Maddie? I just wasted some of boxes, so I have it. Boxes give you nothing but junk, I think, for the trails. I don't know, I can't do. 
Oh, my God. Guys, I'm already on I'm about to be on the third one already. I can't do a certain one. I really can't do this. I don't know if I'm a bot. I think I'm a bot. My hands are sweaty. Oh, my gosh. I'm getting up here. I'm getting up. I only have two more left. I can't see. Okay, this one's pretty easy. I like this one. Swagger. The blue one is the one I kind of like. I hate the red one. The second last one? Yeah. I thought it was something different. 
Oh, no. This is bad. This is is going to be so bad. I want to lose. I don't like this one. I'm going to die. I feel like it's either mad at your jaws I might win this one. Maybe me. Maybe Anthony, because I'm in the lead right now. We're all pretty used to this game because I used to be upset with this game. This one. Is anyone even going to, like, pass this one? Oh, I passed it. This tower is actually really pretty simple, but it's just really hard. And John, you have a jumping coil. You're so lucky. I want a jumping coil. Guys, I'm so close to the end. I'm so happy. Oh, my gosh. I actually win $100. And also, guys, if you win two times in one round, then you get $200. Like, if you win it two times. Oh, my gosh. I bought gravity. Jump, jump, jump, jump. 
What? Tell me why this game. Maddie going to win, guy. Is he going to win with only 55 seconds left? Wow. Is Maddie going to get these fast 50 seconds to get up there? I'm definitely not going to make it up there in 50 seconds. I could try, but I'm not going to do it? I don't know. I'm going. You could believe yourself. Okay. Yeah. You can see anymore. Okay, time for the next tower. So it is round number two and let's start. We all are currently at $0. So easy. Wow. I think I'm going to beat Anthony. Why does he have a purple? No way. I don't like this. I can't do the orange one. 
No, skip it again. The gravity clock goes away. But I'm going to buy invincibility. I'm buying invincibility. I guess you don't have enough. I only need three more little coins left to buy it. I can't do it. Can you buy it? Yes, but I only have a thousand left. Maddie, buy it and then we can be the orange one. Maddie by misfortune. I hope it's not TD. Justin. I think he's on mute or something. I can't hear her. I think she's raging. If I were Justin, I'd go on mute. I would be probably screaming if I were her. What the it didn't even go. It's supposed to go. No, I think it's just the orange one we need to memorize. 
A little freaking. Yeah, but the red things in the way. Everything goes in the way. No thing's in the way. Yes. Once you get to the end of it, I'm buying extra time. Buy it, please. Thank you, guys. Now you buy extra time. Everyone say thank you. Thanks. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. This game sucks. Like it's so bad. No, Alice, no. Just not. And then he still rages. No, it is not. No. Jocelyn, he's doing now you got to buy this coil. It's actually better. Justin wine. Justin wine. She got the 100 books. Okay, so Jocelyn has 100 and all of us have zero. 
Alright. So now it's round three and we're all at $0. Except for Jocelyn. She has $100. The second one is easy. I think we all might be able to win this. There's easy stuff for me in tower, but then there's some hard stuff in the third one. Is Jocelyn going to win again? Oh, gee. No. I'm on the third one. Guys, this is probably the height of ever gotten. You can't jump. I know that. Okay. Yeah, I've done this one before. That's the third one. I'm really good at this one, actually. I didn't even touch that. Guys, I think tower pal is broken. Going so slow. I'm shaking right now. 
Oh, my gosh, kim, I'm back on this one again and let's hope I don't die this time. This is where I died, so I'm focusing. I do. Okay. Oh, my gosh. I did it. Great. Oh, this stage matches my outfit. This stage sucks. I'm not going to be able to make it. Oh, Maddie. Maddie. How are you yelling my name? Don't shake the table. No, I'm a hurry up at this tower so then I could probably win two times. 
We have invincibility because we're too bad at tower. So we need invincibility and we also have extra tags. How bad we are. Does that explain how bad we are? Oh, my gosh, yes, it does. Okay, with invincibility invincibility. It's so much easier. Look, I could just go through that one easy. Can I get there before Maddie? Even though she's ahead of me? I must fell. Look at me. Same one again. I think Maddie's going to win, guys. Guess who's going to win? Imagine you fall. Guys, I won. 
Now I'm going to try to do it again. Let's try to win this again. Why'd you press the time? Because I don't want you to win. I'm not going to make it. I'm not going to make it because Maddie bought extra time. I didn't buy extra time. You could do that one easy. I did it. Okay, so me bracella have $100 and I'm trying to get 200 right now by beating this tower again. Why are you lying? Randy, do a funny face. I got same. Okay, so me, josa and Brazil. But I have $100. 
But Josie go. Now we're moving on. This is our last round. Yeah. Oh, no. This is round three. No, that was last round was round three. Okay, so this is our last round. And the first one is really easy. It's just like this branch one, the pink one. Pink one is really easy as well. I really like this one. I think this is my favorite. I love how we're just not touching. Oh, my gosh. Why a wiggle like that? Why does this freaking stupid little okay, so I'm on the third level and this one kind of looks a little bit hard, but I don't know. Oh, jeez. I'm actually doing it. I did it. Okay, so I'm on Priscilla. Look at Priscilla. That's what you get. Pretend. Look at Priscilla. That's what you get. 
Why did she say, look at Priscilla making fun of me? That was lower than you, but now you're lower than me. I hope you die right now. Please die. Please die. Magical. Magical. Please die. Please die. It's not funny. Fell again. We're skipping this wine. No. Okay, I think I got this purple one's easy. Oh, my gosh. I'm going to sue this game giving me a heart attack. Oh, this is so easy. This is easy. I know it's easy, but I fell. I can't believe it just died. Oh, my god. 
Oh, my gosh. By what coil? The last part is easy. I'm having a heart attack. Just shut up. Shush. This game is so bad, it sucks on a suit. Tower a peck. Why are you not saying it by the real name? Don't care. How do I get up there? 
See, that doesn't make any sense. Oh, my gosh. I'm like wiping my hands on butter. How did this game make sense? See? It doesn't make sense. This game is stupid. That's what it is. It's very stupid. If the owner of tower package watching is. I'm sorry. I hate your game. I just hate it. I'm sorry. It's not my favorite game on Roblox. It used to be. Not anymore. I'm a pro. But I'm also not a pro. I need invincibility to be a pro. If I'm going to be a pro I need invincibility. Please. No. Please. Please. Please. Please. Wait a minute. Look. Hi. Didn't it? You won't so fat. That was our last round and I'm not going to make it. 
I know I'm not going to make it. Maddie. Here's another $100. So now that was our final round and Maddie is $200. I have 100. Jocelyn has 108 and he has zero. But Maddie had the most. So she gets the chocolate. That's how she might as I don't eat it. So we hope you guys enjoyed this video. Make sure you subscribe and find the Jake Crew gimmick squad.

And man, this video's crazy. This one girl, she twitches, she turned it, and then the lads went out watch the video all the way through to find those parts. Look at look at these chat messages. Zeff plays. What's your name, diamond girl? Maddie, but you can call me Mads. And then Zeff plays again, and he comes with a bit of dark fire heart. You can call me Fire. Alright, guys, I used all of my money to open up a Chuck E. Cheese and I put it right across the street. Street of a house that has ten kids. So, I mean, hey, we're always going to have ten kids in here. It's a ride across the street. You know, they told me, Jake, you shouldn't open up a Chucky Cheese in the neighborhood. And I said, shut up. It's going there. Well, we haven't opened yet, but hey, we can give them an early tour. Go. Hey, come on out. Wake up. It's only 08:00 P.m.. Guys, come on. What is this, baby hours? It's 01:00 a.m for me. Come on. I mean, look, their garage is open, and I can't get in through here either. And I can't shut it for them. That's just an open garage gone to waste. Oh, no, wait a minute. I have an idea. Here we go. 

Right there. Now they're putting that garage to good use. Oh, wait a minute. I didn't even give you guys a tour yet. Yeah, so this was all built by Shea. I put the food on the table, though. That's my job. No, I quite literally put the food on the table like I put this food on the tablet. Get ready. We got some nice bathrooms back here. We got the stage where Chucky? What does Chucky do? And then this is where people would go for birthday parties, where they invite, like, the whole class. You know, all the kids in the class that don't like you and they just want to go to Chucky Cheese. Yeah, I know who you are, Donovan. All right, let's speed this up. This is the kitchen. This is the storage room, and this final room is the room where I shower. Hey, man, this costume gets hot. Okay? I got a shower. And this is where I prefer for my fights with Ronald McDonald. Come on. Come on. Well, I mean, that's pretty much the restaurant. Oh, and there's a ball pit, too, but I'm not going in there. Do you guys know what's in ball pits? Do. Do. What time is it? It's almost 02:00 a.m.. Okay, well, you know what they say. If they ain't coming, go get them. I just got to get my car back from the neighbor's garage. Oh, these people are just the worst. 

Look at this. All these lights on and nobody's home. I'm sneaking in and cutting the power. What was that? Wait, what was that? Was that in the game? Do I have another tab? Open. Oh, geez. I didn't see her there. What is she doing? Do you guys want to come to my restaurant? Wakes. Oh, she's sleeping. It's me, Chucky. For Chuck E. Cheese. There's somebody else here. What? The Chuck E. Cheese rat is at our door. Are you okay? Late. Let me in. Let's help her to some Chuck E. Cheese pizza where we definitely don't use leftover pizza. Where is your sister? Oh, I'm right here. I'm her sister. Hey. Hey, man. Hey. What? Do you want to come to my restaurant? No, thanks. Are you mocking me? No. I think you should come to my restaurant. Go away. Be. No, thanks. But we got good pizza, though. Who are you? Are you about to rob this house? What? You kicked me out. Well, now I'm banned off the property. Oh, wait. Another guy on a scooter. Stop. Stop. Resort. It is I, Chucky. He's running away again. He just jumped off the ramp. 

Oh, you think you could lose me? I'll run you over. Totally. The tiger. Chucky the cheese. It worked. Get into my car. Why? Haven't you heard about the Chuck E cheese? My restaurant is open. Everything is free here. Come on in here. I'll change your permission. You're my guest. Okay. Come with me, wizard. Here it is. Do you like it? Rizard, what are you trying to do? It's 08:00 a.m. It's closed. Everybody knows Chuck E. Cheese opens at nine or wait around for a bit. It's cool. Well, thank you. It was done by show. Oh, that's so cute. He's waiting on the bench till nine for Chuck E. Cheese to open. I'm banning him from the property. Kick out. All right. Open the doors exactly at nine. Oh, hi. Welcome to Chuck Cheese. All right, follow me. It's cool. He said that twice. Now. Don't kick those. Is it your B day today? No. Oh, well, then you don't get to shit over there. Sit here, please. Now. Hi. Welcome to Chuck Cheese. What would you like to eat today at Chuck Cheese?

It's going to be my birthday party, but I'm also going to be working there. Okay. Where is everybody? Someone please build me a house. Of all people, why did I have this girl coming? Another person. Welcome to Chuck Chase. Whoa. Yeah, I know. It's pretty cool. Come on in. Are you two together? No. Clearly not. Hey, no. Get out of the ball pit. You've clearly crapped yourself. Ma'am. Out. Now. Ma'am, where'd you go? Ma'am, follow me. What are you doing? What do you stop. What's wrong with you? What was she doing here? Come with me. This way. Right in here. Come on.

Oh, this is the bathroom. I forgot where the kitchen was. Okay, this is the kitchen. He wanted pizza. Just going to do this crap. What am I doing? Smushing this. What is this? Then I got to do this stuff. I'm throwing dirt in it, throwing lots of dirt in it. Then I got to put this crap in here and wait till it explodes. And then you got to pull it out before it burning your hands and it's all done. Who wanted it? This guy did. No, get out. That's it. I got to use 20% of my power. Not you. Sit back. Tam. Right there's your pizza. Okay. He ate one slice of the pizza. He put the pizza down. He picked the pizza up, and then he put it back down. Okay, this is his second slice. I got to reuse the pizza. I got it. No, I'm going to put back.

All right? I'm bringing it right on back to him. Eat this one. It's my special pizza. I spat on it. Never. JK. I'm a rat. Two l's later. Wait a minute. I went, like, to the back and you're still here. You're starting to smell. Are you going to leave? Oh, what? Did that make you sad? Don't be sad, okay? Feelings are just your imagination. I need to stop using more than 2% of my power. Well, at least I got his pizza. We can reuse that. I think it's time I go advertise. And by advertise, I mean kidnap people and bring them here. Crap. There we go. Wait, hold up, guys. What's going on in this chat? You can talk to me about it. You trust me, right? Like they're hardcore role playing. Look what they just said.

Here's a potential candidate. Sir. No, sir, don't go in there. No, I'm just going this happening to me. No, sir. Sir, do not be alarmed. I am a giant rat. Oh, you're right there, sir.

You guys are making me feel self conscious, but my weight, they don't define us. I've been in the server for a very long time. I'm going to go move on to another one to spread my Chuck cheer. Hey, guys, what restaurant do you want me to do next? What place do you want me to public defecate next at? Let me know down in the comments. I did Chuck E. Cheese. Now I can do McDonald's. I can do Burger King. 

Those are the two restaurants I know. Sorry. All right. We've moved states servers. I mean oh, I have a customer. This is amazing. Oh, I got to get in here. Open the door, and I'll run to the menu. They're actually supposed to order here, but I just do it. Whatever. Hi. Welcome. How many? Oh, no. I thought she was about to slap me. I got scared there. So what is it here? It's a Chucky cheese. Here, come sit over here. All right. Here, sit. It's a bit rusty. It is not rusty. Shut up. Sit down. Bad reception here. So mean. All right, you know what? That's it. 2% power. Okay, for my finishing act, I think I'm going to join an empty server and then turn my follow on to let some of you guys in. Hey, since I'm doing this for you guys, since I'm letting you in, smack that like button. Okay, please, please. Who can join me in game? Everyone. Are these people here for me? I can use you to tell you guys apart from regular people. Like, some people have names like Candies Unicorn. You guys'names are usually like flying dead Rat or Spaghettio. Forgettio pigettio. That sounds like a fan of mine. 

None of you guys have showed up. Where are you? This might be a fan. Yo, come on in, man. We got all the good stuff. Oh, we have another person. Sick. Hello, Holly. Is that just judoro? It is. Hey, Judoro. Nice to have you at my restaurant, bro. All right, have a seat right over here, buddy. Sorry, I am slow to type. It's okay, buddy. What do you guys want to eat if you're slow to type?

All I hear is hamburger. Stop saying that. Chuck forgot to pay electric bill right here. I'm going to just walk around to them. Hey, did one of you guys turn off the lights? Chuck went bankrupt.

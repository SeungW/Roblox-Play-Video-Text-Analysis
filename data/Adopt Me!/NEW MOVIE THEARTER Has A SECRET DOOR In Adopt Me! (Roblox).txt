So what should we do today? I mean, I feel like we haven't done anything for a while. We've just been walking around to your house and eating everything you own. But I'm getting kind of bored. We should probably leave the house soon. Booty. Leave the house? What's wrong with staying here and eating pizza? I mean, there's nothing wrong with staying here and eating pizza, but it's just I miss seeing some color. Oh, my gosh. How about we go see that new movie? They're supposed to be a colorful, beautiful new movie by the teletubbies. Do you want to go see it with me? Teletubbies? I don't know. Okay, well, have a look. Is there any other movies you want to watch? There's a new movie theater we could go to, so if there's any new movies with just a little bit of color, please, can we go watch it? Do you think they have any horror movies? As long as they're colorful. But I think teletubbies is a horror movie, and you don't like teletubbies. I guess we can watch teletubbies this time. Okay. Yes. Oh, my gosh. You are going to love it. It's going to be better than you've ever, ever had before. 
Oh, my gosh. Before we go, there's something really important thing important I have to do. It's play song for you. Moody, we are going to play I mean, watch the towel tubbies, and we're going to have a good day. Yes. Let's hop in the car, and let's head to the movie theater. Five minutes latel, and we are here. Oh, gosh. Did they update this parking area? Why is the curb so okay, I keep on scratching my rims right now. Okay, am I allowed to just park right here, or what do they want me to do? Moody, can you try to park it real quick? I can't drive your car. It won't let me. Oh, my gosh. What is it with these rules? Can't do that. Can't do this. Okay, you know what? I'm going to just that's it. Perfect. Thank you. We are at the cinema. I am excited. Okay. Tickets. Hello. I would like to get two tickets for tell us, hubbies. 
Why, hello. This is my friend Moody. By the way, I'll pay for her as well. Yes, charge her 1 million row bucks. Well, actually, I don't have any money. Give us the ticket. Give us the tickets for free right now. He said it'll be $50. I don't have $50. Peel, peel, peel, peel, pill. Excuse me. Give us a ticket. Give us okay, never mind. I'll pay. Thank you. Enjoy the movie. Thank you so much. But we're going to need some snacks over here. Popcorn, donuts, pizza, burger. What do you want, Moody? Pizza. Pizza. Pizza. Okay, we'll have one pizza, please. And we will have one popcorn. Yes, please. And popcorn. Thank you. I am so excited. What a moment. Oh, wait. There's only one person here. Or Mr. Lake. Say not person. Yeah. Okay, so which seat did you get, Moody? I got this one right here. 
Oh, you got that one? Oh, I got this one. Thank you. I'm joking. I didn't actually got right at the front, so we won't be sitting close to each other. Okay, you can sit next to Mr. Leggy. Oh, yeah, I will. I don't know if I want to hold his leg, though, to be honest with you. All right, well, time to get started. Please don't talk throughout the movie, Moody. I really take this seriously. This movie is boring. What? Hasn't even started yet. Stop it. Sorry. Oh, here he goes. It's about to start. Oh, wait, look, it has a sponsor. Make sure to eat the star card sentiment by Robucks. Wow. Wow. This is crazy interesting. Nah, I'm just joking. There is no sponsor of today's video. 2 hours later excuse me, can you quiet down up there? Do you hear me from all over here? Yes, I'm trying to eat my seaweed. 
Oh, seaweed. Wait, wait. Can I have a bite? Can I have a bite? No, you can't have a bite of my seaweed. Oh, my gosh. Are we just holding it like that? I think that seaweed is old. Are you finishing that seaweed right in front of my face right now? Yeah. That is so mean. Holding hands picture. I'm running. All right, well, this is a great movie, by the way, I just wanted to say that it was awful. Zero out of ten. Oh, well, I think we should go back and see it again tomorrow. I mean, it's going to play every single day for the rest of the month, so I think we should go every single day for the rest of the month. Yeah, I'll definitely do that. Great. Okay, let's go home. I think I walked wrong. Did we come from in here or out there? 
I think it was this where we came from. What's in here? Oh, my gosh. They just appear from out there. Okay, all good. We are just walking. Oh, just storage. Sure. I think he's a little nervous. I think he is. I saw I saw some sweat. Oh, gosh. Don't worry. No one uses that many ha ha without a reason. Have a good day. Thank you. Do you think we should go back in there or let's just go another circle. Do you think he's going to notice if I go this way right now? I don't know. Oh, yeah. He's following me. Sorry, I'm not familiar with the exit. Is he following me right now? He's following me. I think I got him distracted. Oh, my gosh. 
I'll go in and have a look. Maybe there's unlimited of free tickets in here for us. Wait, we need more people to work here in our cinema. We need more actors sell overpriced movie tickets. I knew that those tickets were overpriced, and that's why I threatened him with my poopoo. Okay, what else is there over here? There's coffee and there's money. Where you are right now, say, I'm in the bathroom. I'm at the bathroom. I'm in the bathroom right now. He's poopooing right now. Help me, please. Excuse me. Mama, what are you doing in here? Are you okay? There's someone in there. Yeah, Moody, there's someone in here behind bars. Do you think that this is like, half cinema, half prison scenario? You think this person could be dangerous? But bars won't let me leave. Are you sure you're not a serial killer? If so, what kind of serials your favorite? He wants me to work. 
Twenty four seven. Oh, I mean but why are you standing behind here then doing nothing? Get to work. It won't pay me. Oh, no, that's a different story. Okay, I don't know how to get you out of here exactly. Moody, are you okay over there? No. Your car disappeared. Oh. How? I don't know. It's gone. That's weird. Okay, how do I get this person out? Moody, do you have anything to tell me? Wait, I think I have an idea. I'm going to give them a ChuChu train a few moments later. See? Oh, my gosh. You got a ChuChu train. Oh, no. It didn't work. Yeah, he's trying to drive the ChuChu train through, but it's not really working. That's not good. That's not very good. Moody, you're going to have to come in here and help me out. How am I supposed to shake the owner? Well, you're going to have to tell him you're leaving and then come back inside when he's not looking. Tell him that I flew to Mars and landed in my house. 
Okay. And that you're going to go check on me 2 seconds later. Have some coffee over here. Oh, wait, that's a great idea. Give the coffee to him. He's going to poop himself, and then he should be able to just walk straight through these bars. Let's see. Will it work? What? How does that make sense? Just trust me. Drink the coffee, and you'll be able to go straight through these bars 12 seconds later. Well, it looks like he's going to be able to do it now. Come on. You got this. See? Oh, my gosh. Did you literally see that? He just walked through the wall. Wow. Yeah, I know. You're welcome. By the way, I'm a little sad about my choosing train, though. Don't think we're going to be able to bring him. Let's just step on it. Squeeze out of the bars. We need to hurry and leave. Okay, let's go. All right, we got to get out of here, even though it's almost time. Oh, gosh. You know what? 
Don't worry. I got this. Pew, pew, pew. I can't let you all leave. Pew, pew, pew. Oh, gosh, he's got a gut. Run. Run. Actually, the best thing to do in this situation is move around quickly on the seat he won't see. Oh, would he go all the way in the back? He's right there. He doesn't see us. It's fine. He can't see us. This is like exactly this is great. Wow. I can't believe this. Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. Run, run, run. Wait, where's my car? I told you, it disappeared. Oh, my gosh. That's awful. All right, we're going to have to run on foot. Let's go. Faster, booty. Faster, booty. Wait, is that guy coming with us? 
I guess so. I'm sorry, sir, but we don't really know if your story was actually true. If you were actually in a prison cinema situation where you have half prison, half cinema. I've been to those multiple times. They're very popular. So we can't let you into this house, if that's okay with you. Well, thanks for saving me, I guess. Bye. Okay. Bye, Tuddles. Bye now. Bye bye. Okay, go. All right. Well, that was a good an amazing ending, and am I right? I feel like we are life saviors. We should go and watch teletubbies more often. I mean, good things come out of it. I think I'm going to have to sit out next time. All right, guys, thank you so much for watching this video. Really hope you all enjoyed it. We're going to see you soon with another video. Bye.

Welcome back to the channel, guys. Today we have just officially moved into Blocksburg. I have my roommate, Gold, and she actually arrived early to set up the house. I was kind of sleeping, but I hope she doesn't mind. Hello? I'm here. Funny. Took you long enough. Oh, what now? So, so bad. My nose. It's burning. Can you please what? You're making the whole house stink. Well, it's because I was traveling for days. I don't know what you expect. I got here by feet. Wait. Oh, I do kind of smell. Do we have a shower? We're kind of broke right now, so no. But you can brush your teeth and wash your hands until you're less stinky. Are you serious? We don't have a shower this house. Please just go in the bathroom. I'm going to close the door. You're stinking up the whole house. Oh, my gosh. Gold is so sassy. Fine, I'll just brush my teeth. 

Supposedly this helps. Let's see. Brush my teeth. I am brushing my nose. Sort of, but I'll brush my teeth. Hey, Gold. Is there food? Let me check. There is some potato chips and bananas for you. Potato chips and bananas. I'm washing my hands. My hygiene is going up by a lot. Maybe I should cook for some food. I'm almost done. I just need to wash between my fingers and boom. I feel so much better now. Now let's get back out. Hello? Gold, I'm dying. I'm cooking some mac and cheese. Enjoy. I know you're hungry from traveling. Oh, you made mac and cheese. Is this the special one? Did you make it on the stove? No, I just microwaved it. Oh, okay. So it's not special mac and cheese. It's okay. I'll eat it. Oh, this is so good. Weight. Why is there a pizza box on the table? Oh, I was just a little hungry, so I ordered some pizza while cleaning up and preparing the house. 

You ate a whole pizza? There's only one slice. I didn't eat a whole pizza. I ate some. And I saved some for you, too. Stop making me sound like I'm a pizza. You saved me one slice. And what is this? Can we even afford this? Did you buy this? Yeah, I did. I actually picked it up from the neighbors trash. It was still full. Gold, why are you picking up from the trash? Don't make the new neighbors think we're bums or something. Now, come on, let's see our new rooms. Oh, this is our room. It's pretty small, but we're just going to have to deal with it. My bed is the red one and yours is the blue one. OOH, you got me in my blue bed. I see you also brought in my favorite banana statue. Yes, I did. And this poster. Check it out. Oh, it's from when we had our pizza job. 

And we don't have our pizza job anymore. Is there anything in the piggy bank or is. It just for show? It's just for show. It's empty. I told you. We're kind of broke right now. Do we have any other networks? This is so boring. No. We only got this one channel, and it's the best. It's news. Read a book if you're bored. I don't want to read a book. That's so boring. It's the phone. Let me go grab that. This new house is awesome, but I wish we had more stuff in it. Maybe I could go do something. Play the guitar. Nah, that's too boring. What else is there to do? Gold, who is that? It's Rainbow. Chocolate strawberry. Hey, Gold. You picked up. Okay. Thank goodness. I know you and Funny just moved in, but would you guys like a job, perhaps? The ice cream shop is really busy and I don't have enough hands. 

Oh, yeah, for sure. Funny is complaining that it's so boring back at home. I'll definitely bring her out and help you. No. But that doesn't mean I want a job. Tell her no. It's too late. I don't tell her no. I don't want to go to work. I just want to sit. No. You know what? You have to make money. Someone has to make money around here. I will see you in a bit, Rainbow. Bye. Okay, bye. Hurry, please. Oh, fine. We'll go out and see what the ice cream job is like. But I am not leaving the house without a beg. What? We have no chips in here. Yeah, you do. Oh, I ain't leaving the house without blocks. Classic potato chips. Okay, I'm ready. Let's hurry up and get over there. She sounds like she really needs our help. Hey, we got to lock the house. We don't know who lives here. They might walk in our house. Come on, let's go. So this is where Rainbow works. 

It's so busy and it's late at night. Bangs. Ice cream. Hey, Rainbow. Chocolate. Chocolate. Crushed peanuts. Anyway. Oh, you guys made it. Okay. Kim conry. Hurry. Come in. Yeah, yeah, that's right. We work here now. Sort of. Yes. Put on a hat and tie up your hair. We don't want no hair in here. I have tied up my hair, and I do not like it neither. But we have to do what we got to do. Gold, come in. Jerry, can I get two chocolate scoops? Okay, two chocolate scoops. We'll get a cup sprinkles and stop poking me. Two chocolate scoops. Boom. Here you go. Hey, this is easy. Yeah, it is. But I'm not sure if it's my dream job. Let's see. Chocolate, vanilla ice cream with sprinkles. So let's get chocolate, vanilla, vanilla, chocolate, chocolate and a vanilla. And he also wants sprinkles. 

Where do we get sprinkles? Oh, they're right here. Add sprinkles. Boom. That looks so good. Here you go, sir. Hey, Rainbow. Am I doing a good job? I made a wrong oil. Yeah, you're doing a great job that time. I got mad customer away. Gold. Gold, you're fired. Yes, you're fired. Take your chocolate caramel syrup and leave Ben's ice cream stand. No. Just give me another chance. Can I get a strawberry vanilla ice cream with strawberry? Let's get strawberry. We'll take it a little too fast. Vanilla, strawberry, and caramel syrup. Oh, my God. That looks so delicious. Whoa. Where did my customer go? I gave them the wrong order. It's a beard girl. What? We just got trolled. Somebody. Hi, Rainbow. I quit. I'm taking this and leaving. No, you can't quit yet. You still Kate. 

If you get a promotion, I promise you, you will get a bonus of $50 if you can get a promotion in 1 hour. This job is boring. So by. Rainbow, I don't know how you keep up with this. Can I have ice cream? I wanted you guys to help me. Gold, come on. Let's get out of here. Let's go do something else. Wait. One more, one more. Let me just give it to this person. You are fired. She gave wrong orders to everybody. I made $25 out. I made $16. Okay, Rainbow, we will see you soon. We're going to go spend our money. We just made six. Well, I made $16 go up. You don't smell. No, wait. It's me. Why did I keep my hygiene so low? You know what? Let's just go home, get changed, and then visit Draco. Lunas and Rainbow's house tomorrow. Yeah, I'm actually kind of hungry, and I'll go take a bath. 

Hey, before we go home, is that like a convenience store? Can I bite potato chips there? Maybe. Let's go check it out. Come on. Let's go over here. Oh, I wish we had a car so we didn't need to walk everywhere. Yeah, walking takes forever. Oh, hey, Draco. What are you walking? Super busy here. Yeah, this is a pretty fun job. Are you saying that of sarcasm? This is fun. How about we try it ourselves? So we must quit our ice cream job and try this job. Come on, cold. Let's try it out. I am Funny the mechanic, and I am ready to do mechanic things. Please give my motorcycle a purple pink, purple. Oops. Oops. Draca, I think I lost one of your customers. Red, pink. Oh, it's okay. Let's see, please. Okay, I'm ready for the next one. Come on in. The best mechanic is in store. 

Oh, Colt's doing better than me. Hello, beard person. I like my bike purple. How do we make your bike purple? We got a purple spray paint. We just spray it on. Here you go. A beautiful purple bike for you. Purple bearded man. Done. Red. Oh, he really likes paint. How come some of these people don't know how to drive their bike out? Please give my motorcycle a green paint. Oh, it's getting so busy. Come on, guys. We need to hurry this up. We'll get some green. Oh, Draco's already handling that replace his old red tires. Okay, here some reps. One day, I shall ride a motorcycle that looks like this. We are done. I think that's a little too big, but it looks cool. What are you doing, Gold? Look, I'm changing his tires. I don't think that's the right tire. I think it's a moped. Yeah, you have to use the right tire, Gold. Give them everything that's wrong. 

He's rolling out. He's mad at you. Who wants a tire wheel? Who wants a moped? Colt, the job is really hard. Yeah, it's getting too busy. I don't think I can do being a mechanic like Draco. Hey, Draco. We'll see you later. We're just going to okay. You're not going to stay? No, it's not going to stay. Really quick. And we just made eight. Well, I just made $18. How much did you make, Gold? I made $28. Shoo. Shoo. It's morning time. Wake up. Wake up already. I didn't even get to sleep that much. I'm so sore from those jobs. The pain. Yeah. I think maybe we should go for an early morning walk. Okay. Can you brush your teeth before I die? Thank you. Stop, Gold. 

Stop. Just brush your teeth. Brush your teeth in the morning. Okay. My hygiene is looking pretty clean. We should get a shower soon and wait. Gold, I have $400 from last night. I can get us a shower. Really? Yes. That's amazing. Okay. Be right back. I will go on roblox Amazon. Okay, Gold. I will buy us a beautiful shower for our washroom. Let's go into do you want an expensive one? No. We need to save our money. So just get one that's cheap. We have a cheap one. There's either the basic shower or the Hygienic shower. Hygienic shower? Why do you always choose the most expensive? It's okay. We have enough money for it. Oh, wait. We actually need to make room for it. I have to put it outside. No, there's no room, Gold. Why even get the basic one? There's no room for the basic one either. 

We need to expand the house. This house is getting a little too small. We can't fit our furniture. It's okay. I'll put the shower right here. Do you see it? I just put it in. Let's go check it out. What? What? And right inside the bathroom. It won't fit inside the bathroom. Okay. Don't worry. It's temporary. We'll leave the shower here every time you shower. I'll just be in the living room. Okay. How is the shower so far? It feels amazing to finally have a shower. I know. It right. A couple of days without a shower. Yup. I'm getting kind of hungry. Do we have food? Check the fridge. We have this banana. I'll eat a banana. What a delicious banana you have. Don't eat the rest of the food. We got to save it because we'll be hungry later. Fine. 

Let's just go visit Lunar's house. Then where's Lunar's house? Didn't you see it when you were moving in? Yes, it's right down there. Whoa. It's really far. Is it the purple house? Yeah, of course it is. Whose house is purple? Why is there fog in front of it? Does she have one of those cool fog machines? They're so expensive. Look at this house. Where are you guys going? This is my dream house. Wait. What? Did you come from my house? Oh. How was your mechanic job last night? I quit. They didn't pay me enough for the effort. I was getting like, $5 per car. No, that's not good. Oh, no. I think your house is on fire. Lunar, your house is on fire. That was rude. Sorry. I'll just close this. Don't pretend that happened. Okay. Lunar, your house is on fire. Why are you yelling? It's on fire. 

No, it isn't. It's just smoke. It's just smoke. Okay? It's to make my house look cool. Oh, I thought you were cooking. Yes, I am. Oh, that's why it's on fire. I could smell food from outside. That's why she visited you. Your house is pretty and purple. You have food in here? Yeah. Let's raid her fridge. Oh, no. It's $5 for a hot dog. Don't take. You guys can eat the food on the table. What food? Oh, we weren't stealing. Yummy. I'm starving. Draco, what are you making? I just stole some pancakes, and I'm cooking them. Draco, don't steal. Thanks for the food. Lunar, you have pancakes, hot dogs, and tacos. This is amazing. I'll take her go to eat all of it or else we'll starve later. Yeah, we got to eat to fall. Take everything. Oh, Luna, which is so hungry. Anything all day? No, just a bag of potato chips last night. 

And Gold ate a whole pizza. Not to mention that. What? I saved you some. She saved me one's life. It had no crust on it. Why would you eat all the crust off it? What's wrong with you? You guys are just going to visit my house for food, right? Yes. No. You're the best cook, so we're just sampling and trying out your food for you. Maybe you guys should start getting a job so you could buy your own food. What? Everyone said that to us. Rainbow. Lunar, is Draco going to say to us? Draco, do we need to get a job? Yeah. Get a job? Yeah. I have to go to work now. Even I have a job. He just exit like that. Okay. And with the job, I could get oh, I could get a computer. Look at this gold. Hey, let me try. I want to play the computer. This computer is amazing. 

Luna, did you paint this? Yes, I did. We can get all this cool stuff just like Luna if we get a job. Okay, Gold, what job shall we get? Look, I'm flying so high in the sky. Stop, Gold. Stop. You must go get a job. We are getting pizza baker. You guys could try that. It's a pretty good pay. Sounds okay. Pizza. I think you can make pizza together. Funny. That sounds fun. No, Gold. You just eat all the pizza. I won't. Please. I don't want to get fired on our first date. I actually want to raise my career and get promoted. So let's find a job. I have to go to work now, guys, so I'm going to go work. Close the door when you're done, okay? Lock my door. Okay. Bye. Let's just leave here. Let's just live here. Yeah. Her house has everything. We can just stay here and do everything all day. No gold. I was joking. Now, come on. Let's go get a job. We are currently unemployed, but we could be a cashier at Bloxy Burgers. 

How does that sound? I guess. Is it easy? I don't know. Or there's a job being a fisherman. No, I don't like fishing. How about a cashier at Blocksburg Fresh Food? We might get a discount on, you know, watermelons and beans, maybe. Do you think we should do it? Okay. How about we go through the list of our jobs first and then we'll pick last? We could be an ice cream seller. I still see Rainbow working there. Does she even go to sleep? I don't think she does. Whoa, she's crazy. We could be a stalker at Blocksburg Fresh Food. No, I don't like stalking or carrying heavy stock. A pizza baker at Pizza Planet. I see Luna right now. She's mistaken. That's kind of fun. It does look fun. Or a delivery person. Boring. A hairdresser, but oh, that looks so fun. 
 
I would love that. I feel like you need a good resume, though. Oh, we can try. Or you could be a mechanic. No, that's practically it. What? Are we being gold? Let's try being something easy. Maybe a pizza baker, like Luna said. Lunar. I agree. We will be pizza bakers at Pizza Planet. Hello. New job. Welcome to the Pizzeria. I'm glad you guys joined me. It's so fun here. I'm pretty sure you guys will enjoy it, too. Oh, kijoki. So we just place the dough. I'm going to copy. Funny, because I don't know what I'm doing. Add sauce. Go ahead. I've been promoted eight times already. What? How do you do this? I think I'm doing it right. And place more dough. Yes. My sauce say station has nothing. This is a boring past. 
 
Refill. I'm just going to go carry ingredient cases crates, because it looks pretty full. And then you refill the ingredients. You place the dough why are you smacking me with a box? It's heavy. Whoa, Gold. Careful. Here. You can try making one. Here, use my station. Stop whacking people with your grape. All right. A vegetable pizza. This looks pretty easy. So all you do is grab the dough and you place the dough down. Add tomato sauce, add the vegetables. It looks perfect. Now all I got to do is bake it. Oh, no. Oh, no. The whole kitchen is on fire. Well, good job, Gold. You just got us fired. You almost burnt down Pizza Planet, the only pizza place in this town. Yeah, well, it wasn't my fault. I think the machines were broken or something. 
 
No, no, no. You're just a bad cook. We should just find another job tomorrow. In the meanwhile, spare change, anyone? Spare change for pizza? Spare change, anyone for food?

So this place is completely empty, has zero stars, but we're going to get it to five stars today. So the first thing we need to do is make a kitchen. I know it doesn't look that good, but the point is that they're going to be behind glass so people can see them cook. And we're going to have, like, this little beautiful space over here. And this is the order station. Okay, that's going to be good. Imagine cooking here and everyone's watching you. But that's what's going to happen. You're going to be in a zoo. Why is that guy up there? Can you get back here? What are you doing? Okay, we need a second floor. So how do I do this? Boom. Yes. That's a good spot because it's going to cover up this place. We don't want that to be seen. Now we need a roof. It's going to be pure black, by the way. All the black. It's going to be open space, but at the same time, it's going to get those beautiful views. Well, now comes the hard part, because we're going to have to design the whole thing. All right, we need the front desk. Where is the front desk? Okay, I just need some stuff. I need some stuff. You be stuffed. These look good. Okay. Oh, my God. We can buy a toilet, though. Okay, I want a black toilet. Pure black. Oh, my God. That's disgusting. But how do we do this? 

Oh, there's a drive through window. Oh, that is genius. That is smart. Okay, this is really good because this is the part for the chef. Okay. This is the chef part. Okay. So we want to make a guy here, but this is what I have so far. I know it's not that good, but don't worry. All right, so the second floor is going to get the fireplace. This place deserves a little more attention. I'm going to give a tree. I'm going to give them a tree. Okay. They need nature. You know what? This guy's going to be the dish boy. He's going to wash the dirty dishes. We don't have a toilet anywhere. Where should I put the toilet? Oh, this is perfect. Like, right in the middle of everyone. Don't be scared. We can't do that. Okay, I know there's no space for toilet. I have to open this place up. I know I shouldn't, but I'm out of money. I'm literally I'm running out of money and give me money. Oh, my God. Outdoor expansion. Wait, where's the outdoor expansion? Which side? Right behind us. Okay. Around the drive through. Well, that's very romantic. Wait, what's this? What's this? Why is there a wall window there? Oh, my God. Dude, table for six. Oh, no problem, no problem. Okay, go sit. Oh, my God. They want so much stuff. What is wrong with you? Come on, boys. Chop, chop, chop. You think this is funny? Go or they'll kick you. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, give them all. Yes. 

Drink up, drink up. I gave them a little golden light just so they feel more luxurious, because now to get to the point all right, we want to make expensive food. I want to make this, like, one of the most expensive restaurants that you can possibly get. And right now, we're at, I don't know, 15,000. That's not enough. Okay, I want to get to, like, 20, 30,000, but we're going to have to spend more money if we want that. Wow, look at the sunshine. Dude, this is so cool. I know. This place looks really nice. I have to admit. It's not bad. And you get those chefs. Why are the chefs not working? Who's washing the dirty dishes? Dude, he just left. He just left? They all just left. Oh, you have to take some orders. Oh, yeah, that's right. Dish boy. Yeah, you better wash. What are you cooking over there? Wash the dishes. Like, there's no one here. Why is no one sitting? Where is everyone? Dude, there's supposed to be someone here. They're supposed to be like, oh, my God. That is looking very good. Wait, are your sushi rolls? Oh, wow. We're a Japanese restaurant. Oh, look at that. Dude, they're already finished. Wow, that was quick cooking. Like I said, we only have, like, one, two, three tables, and that's bad. We need more tables. And this place only has, like, more overall. We're just not big. 

All right, so we're going to put one giant aquarium table here. Oh, my God. That fireplace does not look safe again. Let's move it somewhere else. Let's put it, like, in the middle. All right, we're just going to put some decoration. Just some decoration. Oh, this place is going to be really good, dude, this place is going to be so nice. I want these dudes to get more view, so we're going to put, like, small. I know this is going to be cramped up, but I don't really care. Oh, yeah, that looks good. It imagine sitting here waiting for lunch. Waiter. This is like imagine having this view. You get to see the Aka. You get Ikea. It's beautiful, isn't it? Who doesn't want Ikea? All right, but that's not enough. You're going to have to get a little bit more. You're going to have to go deep into the game. Now, we want this place to be stylish, but we want to make a bunch of money, so we're going to put more speed, more space. Look, this is going to be for eight people. Imagine having eight people here. One more. Let's do one more for eight people. I know. This is such a sellout. I'm such a sellout. I'm doing way too it doesn't matter. Okay, we're going to make a bunch of money, but you guys like money. We're going to move this because it's just going to look better. Oh, no, don't tell me that. They're inside. Oh, you guys are eating. You guys are eating. Well, I'm doing a reconstruction. 

The store is closed. Dude, imagine they're working so hard. They're cooking up the dinner, and I'm just kicking everyone out. I know they're going to hate me, but I don't care. All right, this place got to be perfect. This place doesn't pop out. I feel like this space isn't used up. I should do something about it. Now I know what I want. Okay, but I don't know if you guys are going to agree. There it is. We want the dragon. Dude, this has got to be Zoko. All right, well, I'm going to move this. This is what I'm talking about. This place, like, this doesn't look good. The dragon just doesn't fit. It doesn't fit, dude. I'm thinking about overall removing this. I want to get more seats in. I don't think I even need this. Okay, we're going to store this in. I'm just going to make more seats here. Okay. Like, one thing we could do, we could put it over here because they don't need that much space. This doesn't fit here, does it? No, wait, let me do it differently. I know these are going to be the cheap seats. Okay? These are the cheap seats. You sit here. If you're late, you're right or something. My restaurant is completely full. That's awesome. Okay. Wait, what? 2.6 okay, that is not funny. That is not funny. I have to figure out what's wrong. 

So I guess the only way to get more food or to get more money, we're going to have to unlock every single food that there is. That's going to be hard. All right, look, this is not boom. Unlocked Scandinavian foodie. I'm sorry, I don't like Scandinavian. Not all of it. Okay. Oh, Russian food. Yeah, that's right, comrade. More Russian. What we got chinese food. What else? Oh, Greek food. There's so much food here. There's so much food that we can do. That is awesome, mate. Italiano food. Yes. Oh, no. Level 15. Okay, we're not level 15 yet, but we got oh, my God. Look how much food we have. Okay, I'll take this, by the way, is my drive through going? Wait, so how does it work? What do you want? What do you want? What do you what do you want? As always, my favorite breadwoods. Don't I have, like, someone operators. Oh, here he goes. I'm not going to I'm not going to do this. Okay. Operator. Where's the operator? Get here. Good. Pick your operator. That's right. Yeah, you better put the work in. By the way, I would love to make the garden behind us, but I'm not sure how we're going to make an entrance there because oh, my God. What's that? This place looks good, but how am I supposed to make this work? All right, you know what? I don't care. 

They're just going to have to walk around. I don't care, dude. It's their choice. Oh, yeah. Wait. Day 68. Dude, this is ridiculous. Our restaurant is so big. I mean, just look at it. I'm going to look at other restaurants as well, but I don't think that anything's going to be, like, this big, because this is, like, completely insane, dude, it's so cool. It's so cool. I want to buy some stuff for the outdoor. We want the outdoor stuff. So where's the outdoor stuff? So is this I don't think this is outdoor. Or is it fantasy table? This looks pretty outdoor to me. I know this thing is not that luxurious, but I don't really care. Wow, look at this line. People are actually enjoy. Oh, look, you gave him the drive through. Let's go. Wow, look at what pirates are. What are you doing here? This is a luxury restaurant. You're not supposed to be here. We're serving luxury food here. Why are we talking like, we got some really good stuff here. This is for our chef. Level 14. And we got level 14 chefs, right? They're not doing anything. What's wrong? We need the outdoor space. We need more work. All right, let's get to work. Eyes. Close your eyes. I know you're going to hate me for this. I'm a monster. But guess what? 

I'm a rich monster. I'm a very, very rich monster. Look, they're going to get an aquarium. I can't put an aquarium here. They're going to get a bunch of plants, okay? So don't hate, all right? Spread the love. Don't spread the hate. Okay. I got some trees as well. Why not? All right, we're going to put some trees here. I want them to have a little more privacy. I think the trees are exactly it. Okay, so this place looks pretty good. I know there's not a lot of space, but there's not a lot of space to work with. I'm hoping that they're going to add more upgrades, because I want a bigger place. Like, what is this, dude? I can't fit a lot of people here, but I'm actually going to put more people here. All right, I got $300. I need a little bit more. Got so many new people that we could put here. Does anyone even use it? Is anyone going to use the outdoor get out of my way. What's the outdoor doing? Table for four. Well, we're full here, but you can go outside. How about that? Let's come outside. How about that? We're completely full. We're stacked up. Yeah, it's such a good feeling when your restaurant is, like, completely full. You're going to make so much money here. Let me check the kitchen. Like, I want to see what the kitchen is doing. Dude, I love this place, by the way. I know. It's so full, but you're not supposed to have a lot of empty space, and that's exactly what's happening here. All right. 

Oh, my God. Tip jar. I forgot about the tip jar. What's this? Breadwood. Southern peppa. Okay, we're going to put this here. I think it looks pretty good. You want to have, like, a salt and pepper everywhere. Okay. Not here. Okay. They don't have enough space for salt and pepper. The big tables do have space, and we want to give them salt and pepper. Well, I guess we're out of salt and pepper. No more for you. Oh, my God. What is happening? Okay, okay. A lot of people. A lot of people. Wow. But still 400 books. Are the people even using the outside part? I feel like no one's outside. Oh, there you go. There you go. You're outside. How about that? Okay. That is awesome. I want to get this, like, completely full. All right, we got $600. All tip jar zero. No one tipped us. It's fine. Don't worry, guys. They're going to tip us later on. All right, this is almost done. Oh, dude, there's more space here. There's more space. You know what? No, I'm not going to put anything there. What do you guys think? I'm going to put this beautiful just to lock it up. Oh, look, they're going to get a candle. That is awesome. Who does not want a luxurious candle? Imagine eating out and getting a candle. Oh, my God, they're so expensive, though. I really want to get a bunch of candles and put them everywhere because they look really nice. You know what? 

I'm not going to argue. What about this place? We still got so much more space here. Like, no one guys, come on. We got to fill this up. What are you doing? Oh, my God. I shouldn't be stepping on their food. There's so much nice things you can eat in this restaurant. You picked this garbage. Oh, yeah. That's nice. That's nice. All right, so why more table? And we're going to be completely full. I want to bake it completely full. It's kind of bad how the cars are just going to ride over here. You're going to smell the fuel. I'm not sure if that is good if you're a customer. Wow, but this is incredible. I love this place. I'm so happy how it turned out. By the way, I love how everyone's dining here, and the view that they get is a bagel is literally like a promotion. They don't see anything else. This view is not the best, but this one has, like this table over here has a really nice view. And, like, these dudes have a good view as well. You get to see the bottom part. And they also get to see the kitchen. You know how they're working out. Like, the kitchen area is just nice. Dude, I like this place. Dish boy, are you washing dishes? I hope you are. All right, guys. Well, I think that this is going to be it. Okay. We did a lot of stuff and yeah.

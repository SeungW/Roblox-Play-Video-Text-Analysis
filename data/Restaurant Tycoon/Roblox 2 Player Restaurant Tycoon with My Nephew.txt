Oh, my God, there's so much people here. The cooker. She's helping me. Yes, she's helping you? Yeah. Okay, I'm going to try to buy some tables here. I don't know which one is a good table to buy, though. We need another waiter. That would be better. Dude, I got something that's so worth it. Koala. Oh, my God. I just made our restaurant look amazing. When you see this okay, wait, let me just get a table, though, too, probably. Give me a table. I can see. I can see. All right, let me go here first. I'm going to show you the table. Teleport cartoon. All right, first I'll put down the table. Where should I put this? I don't know. You can't see me? No, I sang your screen. You should put it right over here where I am. Okay, I will. Boom. Like that? 
Yeah. Okay. And the chairs are kind of weird. Look at the waiter. The chairs are kind of weird. All right, we got more table. We got more chairs. Okay, so first I want to see if these actually work, and then I'm going to show you this listing at Bafras. It looks really cool. I think we can get a lot of customers. Now. I'm going to show it to you right now. Ready? Are you ready for this, dude? Yeah, I'm going to put it right here. Right there. Look at it. Yeah, I spent it all on the dragon. I spent it all. The dragon? Yes. Dude, it was such a good purchase. It was a good push. This waiter is useless. Jala, don't hate on the waiter. I feel bad. He's eating. He's eating. Maybe he's hungry. He's taking his lunch break. I don't care. He's taking his lunch break. All the tables actually work. Okay, so you know what I think we should do? We should get another chef. Yeah, that's what I was saying, but you didn't hear me. 
Okay, well, I'm going to buy one. Okay. Okay. Purchase. Okay, so he's a trainee, though, so he needs to learn how to cook. I'll teach him how to cook. Okay, how about you go to Ikea now and you spend the money? Okay. You might have to buy some cash or Robucks and I'll let you go to Ikea. And just what should I buy? Whatever you want. Just go there and just buy whatever you want. How much money do you have? $350. Go to the store and just buy, like, $1,000. Click that number. Just like, the cash thing. Number five is like a little shopping cart. And buy how much? Just buy, like, $1,000 and then just go crazy in the store. Do what you can buy. And then I'll sit here and I'll collect the money. Oh. Day two. We got 38 points. Okay, we're in day three, dude. Gravy cocoa is leveling up, guys. We are officially a two star restaurant. This is amazing. We're a great two star restaurant. And our trainee chef is learning. Okay, I'm going to grab this. I think. You're going to buy this? Yeah. We can reorganize our restaurant later on. How do I put it down? Something down. 
You go into build mode. Once you buy, you come back. Are you back here? Are you back at that Tycoon? I don't see you. Okay, I did it. That's what I did. I don't see what you did. Are you did you go to your Tycoon? No. Wally, you went to your Tycoon? I'm here it's because I don't know what I'm clicking. Okay, come here, dude. I got a kitchen. Another tell me what you did. Oh, where is it? You put it in your kitchen, your Tycoon. No. Yeah, I told you. You did that. Okay, we definitely need to go buy another table. We definitely need an extra Raider. Dude, this is not good. Are you kidding? We need $500. Oh, my God. Oh, I need to teach his way to how to cook. Dude, he's not learning anything. He needs to learn from me. Oh, my God. I'm getting so mad because I went to the thing that had to go back. That's what I said. I was like I was telling you. I think you put it you bought it for that. 
You bought it for your restaurant. I'll buy the auto, collect money. Oh, you think that would be a good idea? Yeah. All right, fine. I'll do it. Click rapidly. I'm just trying to raise our restaurant to make it an awesome restaurant. Click. I'm trying to get the chef to learn how to cook. Oh, we should get a vehicle. That would be pretty cool. Oh, get a car. Yeah. Boom. Dude, why is this chef so dumb? He still doesn't learn how to cook, bro, this chef doesn't learn how to cook. How do I teach him to be smarter? I am so mad. Did you buy the thing? All right, go put it in here. Go into build mode and buy it. Or maybe I have to buy. Okay, I think I have to buy it. Oh, my God. I bought it, and I lost my money. Yeah, but I think do we have it here or no? No, I lost my money. Okay. So I have to buy it. It's fine. I'm going to go buy it. Okay. Come to Ikea. Tell me which one you bought and I'll buy it. Tell me which one you bought. It's this one right here. 
This one? Are you sure? This one is good? I bought it. I'm going to buy it, right, Chase? Oh, I should buy the TV right here. Okay, I'll buy the TV. Which one? This one? Wait, which one? No, you got to tell me what to buy because you can't put stuff in my restaurant. I have to buy it. Why? Why can I not put stuff in your house? I think that's how it works. Should we buy a desk and, like, some yeah, we should make a set up. But I actually don't have money anymore. Let's just go back. Oh, my God. I got my money for nothing. I spend a roebucks for nothing. Don't use a teleporter because you can go. I think my restaurant is right here, right? No, it's over there. It's over there. Okay, so now I think if you press number one or you go into build mode, now you can build in my restaurant, but make sure you're building in my restaurant, or else it's not going to work. I don't have anything. I don't have anything. I bought the thing and I lost build. It should work as soon as I can do it. No computer restaurant. 
I can build at my restaurant only. But it says you should be wait, what? It says you have build powers in my restaurant. All right, whatever you teach a chef, I will build. Okay. Okay. All right, I got a TV here for us. Where should we put this TV? Right over here. Right over here. Okay, I'm going to do that. And then we got a kitchen. Where am I going to put this kitchen? It's an extra kitchen right here. Right here. Like, blocking here. But then how are they going to get in there. We can just jump. But can the NPCs jump? I don't know. You sure that's a good idea? Oh, I got an idea. Ready? Look at this. Ready? Next level strategy. Boom. That's a good idea, right? Yeah. All right. Oh, my God. I teleported back to Ikea. All right, well, I'm just going to buy, like, a crazy one. I'm just going to spend 500 roebucks, and I'm going to buy the craziest thing in Ikea. What is the craziest thing in here? Honestly, that dragon was the craziest thing. Is there anything crazier than the dragon? 
Yeah, I spent literally all our money on that dragon. That means nothing. Oh, my God. The simulator looks like what about this retail tycoon? I forgot the name. Oh, my God. I just got the best item, bro. When you see what I got, you're just going to be like, you're a genius. You're just a genius. Or I'm going to say, you're so stupid. No, you're going to tell me I'm a genius. Dude, when I show you what I purchased, you're going to be impressed. Okay. I'm going to hire more waiters. Okay. Yeah, that's good. Just need, like, one more. I just literally spent we got three waiters. Now we have three waiters because we have three tables. Okay. Look what I bought. Dude. Wait, let me go in my restaurant. Look what I bought for a restaurant. Ready? What? First, I bought this to buy for decorations. Of course. I'll put it right there. And then we have this lantern right here to make it. The more decorations. And then we got this fish. And then we got well, of course, we need a clock right here so people don't know the time. 
We get that pizza clock. Oh, my God. What is this useless chef doing right this thing? And then look at this. Carl, are you ready for the most important thing? So if the staff want to take a break, they're tired. Look what I bought for them. A bed. No, look behind you. Bought them toilets. Imagine they're like just pooping.

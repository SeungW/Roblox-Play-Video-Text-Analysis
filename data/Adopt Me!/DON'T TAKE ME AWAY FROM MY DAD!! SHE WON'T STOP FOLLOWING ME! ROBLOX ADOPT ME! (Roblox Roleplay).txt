Give my sister a Hawaiian. Hawaiian. This is the life. Goes chilling in a baby carriage, doing nothing, being the cutest babies. I don't want anybody to adopt us. Yeah, nobody should ever adopt us because we're twins and we are so cute together. I am looking for a new baby to adopt. Look at that, grandpa. Look at his outfit. It doesn't even match. Oh, my gosh. I hope he doesn't adopt us. Me, either. Hide. Hide. Who should we adopt? A little baby behind that couch? Anybody? Stay back here. We don't want to get adopted. Oh, there's peepies in this cradle. This ain't a cradle, lady. Go away. This one is. 
Well, that one's mean. He's looking at you funny. Take care of him. I wasn't looking at you, I was looking at her. No, you can't adopt me. We're twins. If you take me, you got to take her. But she's so ugly. How dare you, sir? You know I'm a baby. I got baby awards for being so cute. Hey, hey, little twins. Hi. Hello. Nice job to you guys. Yes. Wait, are you friends with that old man right there? Should be quiet. Wait a second. It says here that the one with blue hair, her name is Fubi or something. Yeah, fubi. That's me. She's very hyper and very angry. But it says the one named Gold here is a sweetheart. Can I just adopt you? Yeah, sure. I like the pink haired mommy. Anyway, you can't leave me with twins. 
But we're not there together. Look, you could go with this guy. Look, he matches with you. I don't want that. Where there was a meaty poopoo head and he is a grandpa. You grandpa, sir. When my cough drops. Yeah, see, he's definitely a grandpa. If you guys are twins, why don't you look like each other? Just talking about Gold step beside each other. Oh, no. I accepted the wrong mom. Okay, fine. I'll take Grandpa. Okay, grandpa, you're my new dad. I mean, you're my new grandpa. Let's go, Grandpa. Let's go somewhere special, okay? Where are you taking me? Let's see. I'm a little bit of hungry, I'm religious a little bit, and I want to go do something fun and funny. You didn't answer her question. She said I forgot her question. We do look alike. Look at our ears. We're fortuino twins. 
Okay, so you're just a crazy baby with blue hair. Do you know what frittoiro means? No, I don't. Can you explain it to me, please? Fraternal twins are twins that are born together at the same time, but they don't look like each other because they're fraternal. Why am I sleeping? Don't place me in there. Bring me somewhere cool. Let's go. All right. Where should we go? All right. I'm a little hungry. Ghosts. Are you hungry? Yes. We're twins. Of course we get hungry at the same time. Well, can you read each other? Draco. Yes. Draco, take us to the grocery store. Okay. Getty up. Horsey. Grocery store, horsey. You're making me throw up. You got to go faster. See, that's why she wasn't a daunting. Don't hold me. I got to grab you like a horsey. Come on. I don't like being carried. The screen shakes, and you don't know how to hold a baby. This is not the grocery store, okay?

No, you're dumb. That's enough play time. I think they have to go eat apple slices. Apple slices? Where? I don't want apple slices. That sounds nasty. 
Go to the grocery store, please? Can I walk on my own two legs? I'm a baby. I know how to walk. You know what? Try to keep up. Well, Fubi can walk, and we'll just carry draco, take this. I don't want this toy anymore. It's boring. What? Yeah, I'm just bored. I mean, a blue rattle is fun and all, but you could do something better. Okay, Draco, bring us to the grocery store. So, here. Come on. Come on, Jack. Jitty up a rattle. Give him a giddy up. Draco, we got to go to the grocery store real fast. Real fast. Draco? Where's he going with a grocery store? Is it draco? I don't have a map. Do you have a map? No, I don't have a map. I know where it is. I lived in this town for 20 million years. Of course. And I'm sure you're not an adult pretending to be a baby. No. Pizza. You know what? I got to go get some pizza. 
Whoa, there's a guy making a pizza. Oh, it's a baby making a pizza. Oh, my gosh. Okay, so do you want a big pizza or a small pizza? A big pizza. Okay, well, I can only afford one pizza. What kind of pizza flavor you want? Well, how many toppings can you afford? I can afford two. He goes on a switch. My grandpa broke. I can afford one. I have $2. So I can give you tomato sauce and one topping. Gold. What kind of pizza do you want? Actually, you know what? I'm going to give you a tomato and cheese pizza, please. No, no, that sounds gross.

That's the only thing I eat though. I only eat Hawaiian. Dude, make him goat. Oh, I eat some veggies, too. Oh, his pizza looks gross.

Why is he taking your salad? I got a best friend. Grandpa took too long to think of his name. So I'm just going to sit over here and eat my pizza by myself. Here, this girl is my best friend. Have a pizza, girl. It's made from the hands of my grandpa. Grandpa, giddy up. Let's go. Let's go somewhere else. To the grocery store. Grandpa, pizza. We got to go. Grand. Grandpa.

Grandpa, someone's out to murder us. 
It's because one time I went to a candy store with the foster parents and then I threw the candies on the floor and that girl was there. I threw it out her face. Was it her candy or maybe? I don't know. I don't know whose candy it was. Do you have a house? No, I don't. I can't afford it. Funny, or I think she's coming in. Oh, she's right there. Oh, my God. Oh, no. I don't feel good about this girl. Girl, you need this girl. Here, have a pizza. I'll make you feel better. Do something. You don't need to follow some babies around. You could go to the park. Take a stroll. Take a stroll in the park. You need a bath. Okay. Draco, run. Run. Lol my face. No. Run. Run. She's scaring me. Jacko, I think she's following us. No, she's not. Okay, well, I need a bath. Draco, where's going to take me a bath? 
I'm going to take you to the lake. You know, I'm just wondering grandpa, are you a hobo? Are you okay? They'll take a bath. School. Are you sure you're not a hobo, grandpa? No, I'm not a hobo. They wouldn't let me adopt you if I was a hobo. Okay, sure. Go check. Cleanliness is going down. I think this place is dirty. It's like we had pee in it. Get out. Get out. Everyone get out. Oh, it must have been me. What? Drag. Did you find that pee? I didn't pee in it. No. Funny. Okay, I'm just saying this whole time to change your clothes.

Draco, am I allowed to wear this? I don't think this fits. You cannot wear that. You're a kid. You're going to get cold, funny, you're going to get you know what? How about I just dress like my grandpa? 
Good idea. Upstairs has some very kid clothes for you. Like this duck sweater. Why don't you just wear this suit? But I like wearing this suit like you, Grandpa. I like feeling my age.

I changed my mind. Draco, a watermelon? Yeah. Do you want a watermelon, Gold? Okay. Thank you. Yes. Okay, I will get you a watermelon. No, that's not filling enough to feed the burger instead. Yeah. Okay, I think you're overfeeding your babies just a little bit. Just a little bit. Why isn't your hunger bugger not random girls asking us if we want to come to her car? I'm not sure if that's like no. Do we say yes? No. Say no. You say no to going into strangest cars. Okay, Grandpa. Thank you. Okay, Grandpa, where we going next? We go in home.

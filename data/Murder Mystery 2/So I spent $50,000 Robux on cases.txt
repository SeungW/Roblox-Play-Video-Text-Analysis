So after making my Arsenal video trying to unbox a million battleboxware stuff, someone in the comments mentioned meta mystery two. A meta mystery two has these godly knives that look really cool. I think I have problems. But that's what we're here for today. So I think this is the godlies right here, the question mark. And it doesn't even say the percentage. Vantage. Okay, so my problem is I don't know what box to open. I want the chroma ones. How do I get the chroma ones? I'm just going to go for this first. Okay, so we just click this then I guess we just got to open the vault full of gems. Let's go. 78625. Define and find 100 gems. 786 boxes. Please say I could skip the animation. No, you can't skip. I fought roblox games. When they involve gambling, they have to show you the percentage. Apparently not. I saw something. 
It was pink. How long is it going to take for me to get a godly? Does anyone know? Is it really that rare? Don't tell me it's like 0.2%. Just show me the pink. That's all I want. The pink. Not red, not green, not yellow, not blue. Not anything. I just want pink. I don't know what's worse. I don't know if trying to get an unusual and arsenal or trying to get a godly on this is worse. Don't know my chances. I just want a pink. No, not that type of pink. Yo, I need to check up with my mudder. Or not. Dude, get out my face. I'm an innocent, bro. Come on, man. Oh no. 
That could have been it. And I would have just been happy for about five minutes. It's like buying a new pair of shoes, right? You're satisfied with them for about half an hour and then you're already over it. This is what this is. Don't do this. Guys. Some say this is a waste of roebucks, but I call it an investment. I spend money for temporary happiness and right now I'm not happy. And also, I want to be a man. Oh, I should probably not say that on a YouTube video. In game. Of course. YouTube. I'm talking about a video game. No, sorry. An experience. I am now experiencing gambling, but for kids. Wow. Do not waste your money. 
This is what I'm here for. You can experience me. Wasted my money. Oh, come on. Please. What? I have 69K left. That's not enough. Oh my God. Bro. Why are you gonna do me like that, man? Bro, it's like it's like my dad. It like shows up for a second and then never comes back. Please just kill me. Give me a nice please. I only have one. Why? Really lost to a loopbox. Why don't want to be an innocent like, just give me something to shoot. 
So if I don't get one godly. Can I ask for a refund, bruh? Wait. It's announced. It in chat. I'm opening crates. I got such a big brain idea. Come to me for free. Nice. Really genius tactic. At least someone understands I'm the type of guy to say thank you when being wrong. That's how I feel about these boxes. 
Thank you for just absolutely stealing all my Roe books. Really? Why? Why does it do that? Come on, just give me pink. Pink, pink. Any pinks. Really? And the trust, right? And then you just go backstab them. It's a life lesson. What can I say? Oh, you're liking out the wazoo. Oh, my gosh. Yeah. What's up? Look at these shoes, man. Those cost more than my life. 
Dude telling me to stop. You know what? I should probably take your advice, but I'm going to choose not to. Finally. How do I get chroma? All right, we need a change of scenery. All right, we go again, but this time we need a gun. How do you have so much money? Winning garbi battles. Got the juice. I know you're a YouTuber. Yeah, I already know that myself, too. Oh, I seen the shark, but give me it. Oh, come on. Another shark? It just keeps appearing. Don't just show me it. Give me it. Tanker, I know it's you. Yeah, I'm well aware as well. Wasn't me. Yeah, what up? Here I am in my garage with my whip with all that knowledge I have and all that knowledge of being dumb. 
Who invented the system? Spending money to get a chance to win something. Why can't you just spend money to get something? Whoever invented loot boxes is probably a billionaire. This is a money mining machine. I've been opening cases for an hour straight and I'm only just, like, halfway through. Why is opening crates on Roblox so, like, unsatisfying? Oh, wait, because they don't give me anything. I've been opening crates for so long, I'm only down to 42K. Let me know in the comments what boxes should I be opening and how do I get chromers? I don't really know a lot about this game. I'll be back for more.

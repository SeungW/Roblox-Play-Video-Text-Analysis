Road. Do you sell cheeseburgers, Alex? No, I don't. The Cheeseburger Room. That's her bedroom. All right, I'm going to stop now being savage tonight. Why are we all doing a spy while you're sleeping tonight? Yes. Okay, then my house is actually coming together pretty well. You're right. What do you mean, you're right? It's beautiful. You guys are all just jealous. You don't even know how to decorate. What? I do, too. You do not. It's kind of hard. It is. I'm going to give myself a nice royal bed. I can't even find the bed sleeping on the floor. I found it. I'm going to Loki. Take a sneak peek of wait, what? Drake, why is your room green? Wait, what? Drake bridge. What? It's really Drake? You didn't know, did you? Your color is blue. 

Yeah, I'm changing the color now. Idiot. I guess he thought that you guys'room were, like, together, that it's supposed to be green to get so fast. What green? It's actually all blue now. He just changed it all back. He did it so fast. All right. And if you look over here, you'll see my amazing kitchen. So, I know it kind of looks like a garden, but this is actually like, the type of food that I love to eat. You made a kitchen? What? It looks like a garden. But that's just the food that I like to eat. There's a puddle for me to drink, and then there's flowers for me to snack on and just and grass. What is shade making? Why? Questions? This is what I like to eat. Do you just bite into those cactuses? Yeah, I just bite right into them. Trust me, I guess. I respect your diet. 
 
Thank you. Hey, guys, don't forget to use star code. Alex, if you're buying any Robucks. It really helps me out a lot. Thank you. Have a very nice idea. So, you see how our rooms are right next to each other? Yeah. I'm building my bathroom right now. EW. You're going to poop in front of my room? Even better. I'm going to shower in front of it. Zach, no. That has to be legal if I want to take a bath. No, Zach. What? Disgusting. Is it jealous you don't have such a nice bathroom like mine? Your bathroom is ugly. Say what? It is not. My bathroom is way better. Yeah? Oh, yeah? What's yours look like? You'll see after we're done. Fine. Okay, guys, so I just added something that I'm, like, very happy about. I'm super excited, so I don't want him to hear me. So my room is right next to Drake. 
 
So I got all of these telescopes. I think there's like, almost one. So I can spy on him at all times. Wait, one? That's not creepy at all. I think he can hear you, Jade. Are you serious? Oh, I hope you don't mind me freak. You're cute. Can I move to a different room? Hey, you're not moving to a different room. Well, that settles that. My room looks so fancy. Oh, yeah? Yeah, it looks like a princess room. It's so beautiful. Oh, wow. Her room really does look fancy. Wait, what? Be jealous. Be jealous. I'm jealous. Whatever. Why the heck are the toilets outside my window to your room? Like what? All right, guys, so this is the thing. Since I'm scared of poop by myself, I decided to put a window in front of my toilet. 

That way I could just keep an eye on you guys. Do you see those windows he put? Yes, you can you know what? See, the door too light. Ceiling goes off. Zach, are you serious? I would be stuck here forever. Yeah, you're right. I just sealed you in there. No. Stop putting your windows there. Stop. Sisters. Like he's putting windows next to his toilets on my side. Oh, my gosh. Thank you, Bob. You guys are so weird. It's time to start working on my my secret design now. I bet it's poop, Rob. No, it's poop. No, it's something better. Don't lie to us. 

It's not a small poop. It is not pat. You want to know what it really is? Your butt. Why butt here. You know, I have a great idea, Drake. Since sometimes you may be sleeping, I got you. You know what you need? I'm going to sneak into your room playing I'll blast very loud music through this. They're a remote. I'm trying to sleep. You know what? Too bad. Turn that off. That music was so bad. Wait, did you delete the thing I gave you? What? Yes. I had to. He said, wow. You know what? I'm going to delete my floor. What are you going to do? Good idea. Everyone go to Alex's room, okay. Where she sleeps. Yeah. Corner. What are you guys doing? Look at the roof. What did you do to the ceiling? Camera swipe. We're going to watch her. Oh, my gosh. 

It's so creepy. She's spying on her from all angles. Drake's turning her whole room below. Drake, stop. Drake, this is the blue room. What are you doing? My room? Everyone thought that Spy Zach was done, but no, that was just the beginning. Drake, have you seen your ceiling yet? No. You might want to check it out. No. Why would you put those there? Yes. I don't want to be spied on security cameras in his room. Wait a minute. What? Yeah, sure. I'll sell it to you if you want. Okay. I'll pay literally a million dollars for that. Thank you. Well, that just happened. Making bank. What? She wants to watch Drake sleep. They thought it was all over. Wait, I can't put them down here as toilets here. That'd be wrong. 

Hold up. I got to put him up in his other room there. Wait, why is there a swing? I'm not even going to question it. Yeah, I'll tell you later. Hey, guys, it's me, light. Don't forget to subscribe because I'm light. And I'll be the light to your shining world. There we go. Now I have two beautiful pools in my own room. You do? Yeah. And you guys are not invited. Jake can come. Thank you. The boys can't. You guys messed up my room. Now that we see that Alex has a new pool, why are you putting security camera alex, how do you like your cameras? Shut up. I'm taking those off. That give room only has, like, toilet. Stop. Oh, yeah. I don't know what to do yet. 

No, leave it hey, I was about to play something there. Are you kidding me? Your room was so boring, I made it more fun. You should be grateful. I'm trying to think here. She allows princess and just trying to make my room look cool. Well, it doesn't look cool at all. Wow. Jack, did you steal my trampoline idea? Wait, what? No. That's Alex. She's putting those in my room. Wait, no. He's like trampoline. I don't even want your stupid trampoline. Wow. Whatever. I'm going to add some dryers and washing machines so you can do your laundry. Yeah, zach, do your laundry. You stink. Wait, what idiot trying to make my house? Well, you do. No, I don't. Here's a mop and a bucket so you can clean your room. Wait, what? 

You're welcome, you idiot. I didn't want that. All right, is everyone ready to give us a tour of your room? Yeah. We're going to be started. All right, so I spoke about it a little bit earlier, but let me go into detail. So, you guys know my favorite food, right? Practice bushes, leafs. Grass is all my food. We don't want it. So I just practice punching over here. I punch everyone to talk to me because that's what I'm training for. This is my hammock, where I just chill. And then this is my favorite part of my whole room. I literally love this part so much. All of Drake like, guys. So, there's my guitars. Here's my little window, and I really like it here. This is where I read. Here's my clothes, so every single one of them is green. What the heck? I only wear green. 
 
Okay, Alex, you can sit if you want. Get out of my dress. Up here is a portrait of my grandpa. What is that thing? Oh, my gosh. That's disgusting. Okay, here's my room, you guys. I got a countertop. My blue light fan. Those are lights. Actually, not a fan. Here's my bathroom. Right now, out here, we have my sword and shields to defend my home from intruders. Microwave blender. We got a toaster fridge. We've got everything in the Drake's house. As you see, I have all golden shirts because I am a golden child. 

Is that true, Zach? Get off my jump shut, Jade. Just kidding. Only Jade can touch stuff in here. Nobody else. Oh, you even have a fireplace. That looks safe. Yeah. Wait, why is it warm at night? As you see, it's right by the opening of my bed, right here. So my head gets really nice and warm in the middle of the night and maybe you'll catch on fire. It totally won't catch on fire. What else? Drake. Drake. Wait, what? Fall asleep. Are you serious? Come on. All right, who's next? So, this is my room. I got a photo of our lovely assistant here. The purple guy a k. Light. That's light's. Great grandma's dog. Isn't it cute, guys? 

No serving good quality food while I'm broken. I don't have enough money for frizz, so yeah, maybe we shouldn't go up here. Why? Wait, what? You're a little upset of me? I try to stop him. Alex. I knew him trying to set up his base right in my house was a bad idea. And I kept telling Drake using my base to spy on Alex is weird. And he's like, no, Zach, it's not weird. I'm like, what? And then, yeah, he did this. This is all Drake's doing. It totally wasn't me. You weirdo. How about we just look at the most fanciest, most royal room in the entire house now?

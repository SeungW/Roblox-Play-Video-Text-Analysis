Hey, guys, it's Kate and Janet. Welcome back to our Vlogs video channel playing P. And today we're gonna be playing the Winter Holiday map. And before I get started, I'm gonna get a new skin. I'm gonna buy ringdessa, but I'm gonna be the frost sticky today, so let's just buy winter holiday. Oh, I'm it okay. Almost. So pretty. So did everyone get their presents for each other? Hey, look. Everyone changed his holiday colors. Just give me ten minutes. I'll be right back. Oh, I look so clue. I'm, like, see through. Can I show you something real fast? Yeah. Look here. Do you see that? Yeah. I can reveal the item of thanks for 4 seconds, I think. Or like 3 seconds or something. I don't know. That's cool. 

Here I come. I'm free. Oh, I swung in the ice castle, too. And on the Survivor screen, it's much more foggy right here. But on my screen, it's so clear, so I can see through everything. This map is pretty big. Oh, hello. Ted. Kind of big. Kind of. Not big. It's so pretty. Ted seeing, like, smoky snow stuff. Ted so fast, though. I see another person all the way over there. I'm so slow leader right now. I see you. I see you. Never mind. Where are you? Oh, this one in here. Wait, no, this one AFK. Okay, got them. 

I don't know if they were trying to hide or whatever, but I got them. One person down. Oh, this one in here. I can see right through the ice. Oh, my gosh. I was so close. You can see right through the ice. That's not fair. Yeah. Plus right through my body. So that might be a little bit of angel, too. Oh, no. Ted stepped right over the trap. Someone stepped into my trap. Janet. Janet stepped into my trap. But now she's fast. She's over there. I'm going to go for Janet. Oh, my gosh. Are you jumping around? No. Why do you not know where you may am? No, I lost. You good. I'm so sad. That's good. What's? Had no, chad. There's someone else right here. I'm going to try to kill him. 

You're mean oh, someone's thrown my trap. I wonder who it was. Janet? What do you mean me? Why would you ever say my name? Because you're suspicious. Oh, this one here. How dare this map is really big. I feel like yeah, you hide in the trees and stuff. Oh, this person is pretty good. I haven't seen you in a long time. 

Oh, this person is just no, they're using speed boost. Yeah, I got away from you one time using speed boost. Oh, you look slowed. Yeah. When you step in the trap and you use speed boost, it's so great. Are you kidding me? That's not good. Come on. Come on. Step in my trap gate. Yes. I got some. Huh? I escaped. What? Yeah. I didn't know that was the last present to give to the Christmas tree. I was just checking people. Tim and he was kind. I'm all right. I didn't know. Let's see. There's one person left. Who are they? By the ice castle thing. Okay, I see him. Oh, that's the guy who runs around the house. Stand behind the house. Okay. Just wait for him to come around. Ha. Yes. Yes. Oh, it's so cool. 

Your sound effects, so cool. You like, break them. Yeah, like glasses. Like or like ice. Oh, yeah. You just didn't catch me. You were the only one I didn't catch, but that's it. Everyone else, I got five kills. Okay, this is the next round, and this time I'm a survivor and someone else is the piggy. I need to find gifts to give to all of my friends or stuff. Yeah, nothing here in the snow pit thing. I found a Dray doll in the maze. There's one of the sword thingies that Zizzy uses. I forgot what I don't know what they're called. And there's a robot on the floor. The sword thingy is in the cabin next to the maze, and there's a oh, okay, okay. That's the last thing we did because there's only two stuff in the snow, right? Yeah. Well, Piggy's over here by the ice castle thing. 

And I just got a Jado for a Draffy. I don't know if it's a bottle or not. I don't think it is. A player got selected. I'm running it, by the way. Okay, I know that goes where? Balmy. Just go to the house on the very end because I wanted to search this ice place. Okay. Tad did the sword. Okay. Wrapped the present. Oh, wait. Ted died and wrapped the sword. Amy could use this bot news book about optics for her research. There's a robot on the floor that I found. Earlier, I picked up a gift from Ted's dead body. I got to place this underneath the Christmas tree. 

Okay, I'm going to go back for the robot. Take careful. The piggy is in the main house. Okay. Why don't I go this way? The robot's over here. You know where the robot goes? No. It might go to maze. Yeah. Okay. Georgie would love this toy robot, I think. Okay, what else do we need? Did we do the white key? Careful, piggy's after you. I know. Okay, there what else? Let's look around. We haven't done the white key. Okay. Okay. Do you know what the carrot is? No. I'm going to search the maze. 

I found a carrot. Where? It was in the garden. Carrot goes I found the white key. Okay, I think the carrot goes into the white key door, which is over here. Like the opposite end of you. Yeah. Where is Piggy? Is the last thing we need Yale? I don't know. I did this is my third thing. Okay. Because you did the jacket. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Hurry. Go. Oh, yes. Okay. Story time. You won't believe what just happened. Some weird creature was chasing me this whole time. Did any of you even see it? I ran through the cabin with it behind me. Strange, we didn't see that at all. Also, did you just run out and find gifts for all of us? Look, what matters that we're all together. 

I agree. So now that we're here, let's exchange gifts. Thank you so much for the carrot cake. I'll try my best to save it for later. Yummy. Yeah. And I absolutely love this book. I will be reading it over and over for a while. A fencing foil? Now it can be just like Zizzi. Behold. Careful, Zizzi. And be sure to share that with Z until we get another one. Thank you so much, Kate. This looks like the one back at home. And it means so much to me. OOH. A dreidel. Come on, everyone, let's go play who love. Someone else did a dreidel. Happy holidays, everyone. What? Someone else did. Draffy. Dreidel. I don't remember doing that. Oh, I did that. Oh, okay. I think okay, guys, that was less everyone's gonna do. 

So we have fortunate day, guys. We hope you enjoyed the video someday. Thanks. Watching if you introduce you a big thumbs up and see you in the next video. Bye, guys.

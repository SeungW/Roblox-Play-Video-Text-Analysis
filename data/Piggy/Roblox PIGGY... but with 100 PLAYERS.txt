Piggy, but it's a hundred players. This is gonna suck. This is gonna be bad. Basically Piggy but Bot Modes have ten bots and a hundred players all out in the game. Oh, my God, look how many this is even like, that full, though. Who can join me? Yeah, you idiots can join me. I don't care how ugly you are. It's getting late. Maybe we should get some rest. What if I put my minecraft bed next year's, you know? Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. All right, I'm going to join this one so every single human can follow me. All right, so we're just going to watch the server fill up, and whoever's piggy is going to have an actual just panic attack at how many people are about to pop up in here. Oh, God, he just shot him. All right, let's open up the store. They're starting to flow in. Come on, soldiers. We can defeat him. Oh, my God, there's a lot. All right, is he coming? He can't stop all of us. He can't do it. Oh, God. Guys, help. You idiots. Help. Let's make a run for it, boys. 

Oh, God. Haha. What are you going to do now? Oh, God, this is getting laggy. Oh, my God. Oh, God. Who's even dying? Oh, God. He's lagging. Yoink. No. All right, let's see. He has to kill all of these people if he wants to win. Yeah, I don't know if that's really happening. F for my dead fish. He died today. I have a video of my sister's dead fish. You guys want to see me reacting to my fish dying when I was younger? Hey, we're getting rid of Candace. There was me and there's my sister, and there's a dead fish, and she was slightly sad. It's like there's just a mountain of, like, poop in the toilet. He was great. He swam all the time. He did swim all the time. Thank you, Albert. He was really funny. He always banged his head on the glass. Worst psychopaths. 

We thought he was sleeping, but he was dead. All right, I don't want to wait, like, the whole ten minutes, so I'm just making my own VIP server. I group shot of this, but hey, I'm supposed to ask for, like, some videos, like, the video, if you want me to do more group stuff, if you want me to involve you guys in my life. All right, I'm trying to get them to vote for House. No. Vote for house. Idiot. Don't vote for school. I hate my life. Haha. Ten bots. Bots. No, idiot. Stop bot. Oh, my God. Bro, this server is like this server is going insane right now. All right, 54 people have voted for bot. Oh, my God. Let's find those keys. Yeah. Place that George pig was last seen. I haven't seriously played this map in a while. Well, not that this is seriously playing it because oh, my God, there's so many of us. Everyone just started just like just spreading out. They don't even really know that I'm here. No, mine. Let's actually try to beat this. Idiots. All right. 

Red key. No, I want it, bro. Who took the red key? Oh, my God. You guys are going to mess it up because you're dumb. We can't win now someone probably has the red key. It's probably going to take like ten minutes to appear in their inventory. No, they're just jumping off the club. That's not an actual piece of wood. Oh, my God, they keep doing it. Oh, my God. The piggy isn't even out yet. Oh, there's a piece of wood there. Oh, God. Okay. Yeah, the server. There's maybe too many people in here. All right, well, now that so many of them are dumb and they're actually just jumping off, there's less people in the game now, and that will make it less Laggy. See, it's actually kind of operating. Kind of where's the piggies? Oh, my God, there's so many. Who took the red key? Dude, we could have been done by now. Piggy has woken up. Piggies have woken up. Someone did it. Yes. Finally, dummy. Where is Piggy? Oh, my God, there is so many of them. Oh, they're coming up here, aren't they? Oh, God. Yeah, that guy's. Oh, my God. 

Do they just take out like a huge chunk of people? Oh, no. We're all up here safe and sound. Oh, my God. They're like falling down. I feel like it's Lagging so much. So they're all just going to randomly teleport up here and we're all going to die. My PC can't run this. This is how slowly catches on fire because of this. Oh, God. They go kind of quick too. Oh, God. Oh, no. This is bad because I'm not going to be able to see my own death. All right, maybe I'll just go through here. No, can't do that. Oh, no. I'm hearing people die. The more people that die, the better, because America already has overpopulation problems. No, it doesn't. But the more people that kill, the less Laggy will get. Oh, God. They go kind of quick, though. Oh, no. What do we do? None of us know what to do. Are they over here or they're actually just stuck in there? All right, what's the plan, boys? Oh, God. Oh, God. There's more coming. They have backup. Oh, no. Oh, God. What do we do? They've breached. They've breached. Oh, God. They're all dying. 

I'm going to try to get through here. Oh, God. There's one coming up. All right, there's one right there. Oh, God, there's one right there. Maybe the basement will have what I need. I'm dead. I died. I died. No way. Oh, my God, bro. Wow, that's hard. It's only difficult because it's difficult. All right. I waited that entire time. The playlist is covering like half the stuff. I am all these people's. Mama. No. Vote for gallery. Vote for gallery. No, gallery versus school. All right? I don't care which one it is. Okay, whatever. It's going to be. School, please. All right, whatever. School. Whatever. Bots. Vote Bots. No. Vote bots. Okay, player plus nine bots. That's fine. I just typed in boats. All right, player plus nine bots. As long as there's ten piggies, that's all I care about. Sorry about this beat I've been working on. 

People keep spamming. Like, someone was spamming, like, really inappropriate stuff earlier. There's nothing I can do. I didn't give birth to any of these idiots. I don't mind it being the school map. I beat this, so I don't care. I know I just posted a piggy video, like, two days ago. Whatever. This is different. This is not going to be as chaotic as the last one, which I kind of like because I feel like because when everyone walks in the same area, then it starts to get really laggy, but then everyone's going to die really slowly. All right. Oh, my God. I wonder how many people are going to walk into this. No, I want to see, like, a stampede of people. Come on, gang, let's go. Piggies have woken up. Oh, God. Look at all these people. Where did the piggy spawn? Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, that's a scream. All right, now it's getting a little bit laggy. Now I can't see a thing. Maybe because it's laggy. I can kind of, like, weasel my way out of this. All right, nobody saw that. Oh, actually, hardly any of them saw that. 

They're actually accomplishing stuff. I'm proud. And I'm also confused. Oh, no, sister. Oh, my God. That's loud. Let's just take a look down here. Oh, there's, like, six of them. You know what? Okay. Yeah, they're coming back down. Oh, God. Okay. The more people that die, the better. Like I said, I'll get less laggy. I wonder if no, you'll see, all of them start turning around, too. They all just start turning around. I love that so much. It's not even because of me. I get lost in the crowd. There's just too many piggies down there. All right, let's all go down. Oh, wait. Oh, is it safe down there? I'll let some of you can you put on some clothes? That's such a yucky howly. Scream. Oh, God. There's one right there. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That, like, blended in with us. I have to spam for them to use their keys. Oh, no. Okay, yeah, take the L for me. Take the L. Oh, God. There's another one right there. What do we do? What do we do? I don't know what to do. 

Oh, God. There's more that way. All right. Oh, God. Okay. Yeah. They're starting to die. That guy still hasn't put on clothes. Here, how about I'll close this door and then sacrifice yourself? Oh, God. They're making their way in. What do we feel my way out. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. We safe this way. Miguelito, you want to go check? Are they down here? We're good? Nope. Closing that door. Blue key. Yes, I will take it. All right. One right there. One right there. Kind of. Oh, dear Lord. A lot of people are actually dying. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. One, two, three. All right, let's just chill in here for a bit and see what happens. Oh, wow. That's a man. Okay, good. Okay, this is becoming really scary because it's not lagging as much anymore, so you can actually kind of see them chase after you. Oh, there's so many guys. Die. Die. Do something. We got to go. We got to go. We got to go. We got to go. Oh, no. 

Sister, come on. Chase him around the corner. Where is he? Oh, God. Oh, this might be the end of it. All brothers. We good. No. That was really close. That was really close. I must have died. What do I do? I don't want to die. All right, going this way. That's why I say, guys, go in front of me. Go in front of me. Your life means nothing compared to mine. Close that. This one's like hiding behind these doors. All right, we're going upstairs. I don't remember where to put the blue key. Oh, God. Okay. No, that's bunny. Oh, we gave the carrot. The bunny good. No one of you is going to die. Bunny, do something. All right, open it up. This door. All right, we're in the clear. That guy is okay. Yep. Oh, no, close that. Close that. Okay, now I can go up here safely. Thank you for sacrificing your life. I want to try to make some progress on this, but it's like this ain't easy. Oh, blue key. Oh, my God. I was literally holding everybody back. All right, come on, purple key. Give me God. 

Nobody somebody take the L for me. Oh, my God. There's, like, four after me. There's, like, four after me. Somebody died. Somebody needs to know that somebody was me. God, that's difficult, right? I tweeted out. No one's joined yet. Oh, yeah. The last server broke, by the way. Unable. No. Why? Unable. Okay. There no wait, dude, people need to join now because it's just about to be ten piggies against me. Join, guys. Okay, cool. It's sent now. Okay. People are joining. I was really scared that it would take them, like, 30 seconds, because sometimes it does. All right, cool. Plank of wood. Oh, my God. We need the red key. Are you kidding me? Yes. Use that. Use that. Use that. We're actually being productive. Yes. Perfect, right? No, I wanted it. I wanted that. You know, purple mine. Okay. Purple key. Piggy has woken up. Where does Piggy spawn? Because this could be really bad. Oh, yeah. I hear a lot more footsteps now. 

Oh, God, yes. Oh, God. I'm hearing a lot of death. Oh, jeez. All right, this probably isn't that bad. They're probably just trash. They're open that door up. Oh, God. Yeah. Okay. It's bad. I wanted this map because it's really, like, packed and condensed. Dude, I'm too scared to go out. Oh, God. We can't even go up the ladder. No, that's not going to work. Oh, my God. They're following down the stairs. Oh, God. Yeah. What do we do? Guys, this is bad. This one's way scarier than last. Oh, God. Okay. Yeah, they're starting to close in on us. I don't think we'd be able to last the full ten minutes, actually. Should I just make a break for it while they're still oh, God, no. It's, like, too late now. All right, so when I see him swing, I will make a break for it. No, I'm too scared. Oh, God, I made it up. I made it up. I made it up. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. All right, purple key. That oh, no, sister. I almost just ran straight into him. Okay, he fell down. 

Can I move past him? What are my options here? Maybe he just needs his space. Wait. Okay, we're good, we're good. We're good. We're good. I can just go up here now. I can open this, right? I can open it. It won't let me. The game broke. Move there. Give me it, bone. Okay, that does, like, nothing. All right, let's go through. We got this. Oh, no, that's too many. That's too many. Oh, God. No, they're going to teleport. I'm going to die. No, wait. I have to go this way. I have to go this way. Oh, God. Yeah, they're just falling on top of each other. All right, we're safe for now. Oh, God. Are we safe? Oh, no. There's one right there. Okay. No. Is there anything we could do? Where's Doggy? I could give him a bone. All right. Wait, no. I'm closing that door on you. Okay, never mind. I'm actually going right back to you guys. Actually. No. Oh, my God. I should have died there. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Come on. Open up, open up. Okay, he fell down. He fell down. All right, close that on you. 

Have fun dying, losers. All right. Okay, we have a new pathway. We can go through here. Good. Oh, God. See how it's like not lagging anymore? Not lagging as much. This is bad. This makes it way more difficult. Oh, God. Okay, the next time they hit someone see, okay. That guy was going to die. That guy's going to die. So I can cut out. Oh, no. I'm going up. Here, take this. Sister. Piggy is gone for okay, yeah, that doesn't really count for much, though. All right. Green key. Oh, no. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. They're actually going fast now. Stop it. No, that's the opposite. Oh, no. Okay, well, one's coming up. He's coming up pretty quick. I hope he kills you. Oh, no. Oh, God. Okay, gotta go down. So green key should open up something. All right. Going down. Are we good to go out here? Oh, no. That one was so difficult. All right. Trying this again. 

I feel like we could actually get somewhere if we really put our minds together. Look, if we put all 100 people's minds together, we would have one full functioning brain, like, one normal sized one. All right, give me 1 second. Whoa. Yes. Hammer, hammer, hammer. Perfect. Oh, wait. I have to hold on to this until the very end, because I have to hit the wooden boards at the very last door. Oh, one of these idiots is oh, my God. All right, it just started the timer. Oh, my God. That took so long. What happened? Okay, that thing. Wow. They're actually making progress. I think there's, like, a select few people who are actually getting the keys and doing all the work. Hey, piggies have woken up. So I'm just trying to lead all the idiots, the potato brains, over to me. Then that will leave the people who are actually getting the keys. Then they can actually open the lockers, get the keys, do everything they need to do while this guy just sits here and waits. All right. A lot of them are running away from something over here. Let's see. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No. All right. That girl is going to die. Oh, my God. 

Oh, God. That scream. There's so many of them. Like, everyone's up here. See, I don't want to be leading the pack right now. Oh, God. Oh, God. All right, I'm going down. I'm going down, and I'm shutting the door on you. Is it coming through? All of them went down. All of them thought that I went down there. I didn't. All right, who's going through? Okay, it's just you. That's fine. Close the door. All right, we're good. Just you and me, man. No, don't tell them I'm in here. I'll go down here. Look at all them. Oh, God. Oh, God. Look at all them. All right, just going through. Where is it? Oh, God. Oh, God. Over there. Oh, God. Yikes. This is not going too well for us. Oh, they're going that way. Good. I want to run past them. I want to run past them. No. Oh, God. Oh, God. Is a piggy right there? Come on. Let's figure something out, guys. No, don't close the door on me. All right, they filled out. Now's my chance. Now is my chance. Now's my chance. Oh, God, no. Oh, dear. Can we go down there yet, bro? Who's holding the other one? That's holding us back, bro, please. We're getting close. Who has a thing for right here? 

Who has it? Oh, God. There's Piggy. I think piggy is really just trying to target me, and I understand. No, I got to run through. I got to run through. I got to run through. Okay, I'm safe. I'm going through here. Oh, God. See, piggy's coming after me. All right, someone died with that, so that freed up. I don't think we need that, though. All right, he has a silver key. Good. Yep. There's piggy. Okay. Nope, nope. It won't let me through. Okay, thank you. Oh, yikes. Bro, if somebody just uses this right here oh, they did it. They did it. Come on, come on. So I literally watched somebody have the silver key earlier. Oh, God, no. Yeah, lead them back up there. Lead them back up there. No, don't jump back down here. Come on. We're close. Oh, God. Okay, I'm going. I'm going. I'm running away. Oh, yikes. Oh, yikes. Oh, yikes, oh, yikes. No, bro, I hate everybody in the server. God, I knew he was targeting me. Bro, who had the silver key? Oh, my God. Dude. All right, well, there's Piggy with 100 people. 

Does it work? Yes, it works perfectly fine. And if you don't win, you suck, and you should feel bad.

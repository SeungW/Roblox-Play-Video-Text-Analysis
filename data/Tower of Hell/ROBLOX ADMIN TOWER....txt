Today, I get to do something that I've been wanting to do for, like, a year now. So I really like playing these parkour tower type games. Specifically, this one made by Cracky Four, and he has given me admin here. I can do whatever I want, and I have been wanting to do this at, like, any type of Abbey Tower game for the longest time. Parkour Tower is my favorite one, though. I mean, in this one, you get, like, grappling hooks and stuff. So if you suck at the game, you could just use a grappling hook, like, halfway through and probably still win. Or you could play it a normal way and get extra credit for playing it normal, but I get extra credit for making people suffer. Oh, you guys wanted to play a video game. Yoink, later. Hey, stop cheating. AHA. Yeah, try that. So these blocks disappear after you touch them. There you go. It's just right over here. I'll move it slightly closer. There, you guys. They just get overwhelmed at the thought of jumping over there. Look at this. It's possible. It's just not easy. Look at that, guys. 

You can still do it. Hey, I don't remember where the block is because it's invisible for me now. All right, there it is. I'll move it back. Let's see how you guys perform now. All right. Speed Coil. Okay, well, go back down. So I have this command that just moves people slightly forward, and it's really annoying. Like, here, look, boop. Uhoh, here, uhoh she probably thinks it's Lag or something, but no, it's me. I'll just do it by one look. What's wrong? We make him. I need to fly to the top. I'll just teleport to someone. Look at this. Whoa. I would hate everything if I were him right now. He's already back on his grinder, though. All right. This girl is going to hate everything. Yoink, I feel bad because she's so close to the end right now. Hi. Yoink. Whoa. 

I want to know what she's thinking right now. Why aren't you you should be complaining right now. Stop. Why are you just so on your grind? I'm the best at this game. Who agrees? You agree, right? No. Damn. No. I think you meant to say noob. What did you just say to me? What the why did you just get rid of my gun? This is how you motivate people to do hobbies. You take away their legs, they do it now. Like, to mention two things. You can play this game link in the description. I genuinely really like it. And also Merch on sale Friday 21st. Get it? That day and other days, too. Maybe this is one of them. Justin Bieber over here is wearing something, too. If this guy couldn't even put together enough letters for a username, I doubt he can even accomplish this. Let's see how far he can go with me shooting him. Be motivated. This is motivation right here. All right. I have finished it. Look, I'm a hacker now. How terrible would it be if I just went like this? 

Oh, my God, he's going all the way down. Why don't they complain? Dude, I have a really good idea. So basically, next person who gets on this just going to make the whole thing collapse. If anyone can even actually get up here. All right, we got some people who are almost okay, never mind. Oh, my God, he's so close. He's so close to defeat. Oh, no, not that defeat. He's about to do it. He's going to do it. It is I, your worst nightmare. Die. Oh, my God. It's just falling on everybody. He was trying that for so long. It's just this here that kills everyone. The things are getting flung everywhere. Oh, my God. Stop. All right, so basically what they have to do is make this jump from oh, God. I didn't mean to. All right, good game, ladies and gentlemen. You guys tried hard, but not hard enough. I might as well put my flag somewhere. Look, if I'm going to annoy people, I need to actually go through what they're going through. 

Easy, Eink. Okay, thank you. Let's find out who is Admin Abusing. How? I don't know. Sometimes the answers are right in front of you. No more of that, all right? I want, like, a lot of this to collapse, so I'm going to just do that. Let's see how this looks. This is going to knock everyone down. Oh, God. Go do the hobby. You can still do it. It's still possible. I'll show you. Oh, God. Sob. I guess the new update broke in the game. All right, guys, it's still possible. Here, maybe I can undo it. No, that's not doing anything. Oh, God. Gold medal earned. I did it. Ladies and gentlemen. What has happened now? Oh, God. Hey. They're all going to earn gold medals. Roses are red or blue. My life sucks. All right, that girl reached the top. How did she do that? I didn't see. 

Guys, I'm actually helping people. You ever heard of it? I'm going to just shut down the server. You do not have permission. See? Look, guys, everyone's, we stacking gold medals. Three people have gotten gold medals off this. I think four, actually. Let's try a different one. I really like when the tower collapses, cracky the creator this. He just sent me his message. Someone DM'd this to him on Twitter, I think. Tower keeps breaking. Don't know if you guys are trolling, but something happening. People are taking notice. All right, she's going through these little yeah. No, I'm destroying it all. I don't care. No more of any of it. One SEC. All right, just watch. Everyone, fall to the bottom. Two people have reached the top without using a flag. What? Oh, I guess it flung them up or something. It's going to take a while. For that to fall. Abby, soup. Report. Aubi soup. Aubi soup. Oh, God. There's nothing. There's nothing anymore. Guys, we need to start a new land. 

This guy just got this to the top again. It's simple. You just go through here, and then you do the hobby. This one, you got to oh, no. Ugly. I just you were too fat and you broke it, my lady. I'm sorry. No, I'm hey, Roblox, can you let people put, like, the last word of their sentence in the bubble? How? I am reporting you now because of this. I do nothing. And that's the issue. You could have stopped all of this. Now you must suffer. She left the game. You can tell when someone rages when they, like, this person in the chat, they just smashed their keyboard, and then that happened. So this is the perfect server to do that, too. No, wait. That person's not in the game anymore because they literally raged and just quit. This is how people hack in Tower of Hell. When did that get, like, extremely boring? Because what I like about this game is you have the option to not make the timer go out, but in Tower of Hell, whenever you reach the top, well, I guess it's the same in Tower of Hell. Never mind. Finally. Look. 

Poop. Poop. Look at that. Why wouldn't you want to do that? I feel bad. I swear I will reward them, but this is something I must do. Wink. They were so close to beating it. I swear, when time is about to run out, I'll teleport them back up here. Look at them just continuing their grind. I wonder if they know that it was me who did that and not, like, some sort of awe. They fell again. I'm trying to find the person who I messed up here. No. Do the hobby. Stop. Do the hobby. I have a very bright idea. So I'm going to do that thing where it kind of moves everyone slightly over. Five people just fell. It feels like lag when it happens to you. It doesn't feel like a hacker did it or someone did it to you on purpose. It just kind of feels like the world hates you, you know? Like you just had some bad luck. Dude, who's all the way up there already? Are you hacking? Cynical Billy? I'm always one step ahead of you. Poop. 

He was, like, speed running it, too. See, it's like the sad thing is, they probably think they did something wrong because he's not saying anything. He's not blaming it on, like, a hack. And see, now I ruined his flow and he just left the game. I do feel kind of bad when they leave the game. All right, let's try this. Boop. Let me just be very blatant about it and just explode everybody who hacking. Oh, wait. I'm flying. They can tell it to me if I ask that. No, it's always so hard to understand. Noobs. It's like no. What? They just say things and hope everyone else understands them. I guess that's life. This guy is cursing at me in all kinds of languages. No, it is. It I am. I just up a as a noob. I feel you on that one. Let's see if she says no to this. I'm just deleting most of it now. That probably really broke the game. Whoa. Look through here. It still looks like it exists. Then you walk through it's like, bro, what happened? Just got catfished. They're all undo it. Will that bring everything back? Nope. Their game's broken. All right. 

This person has been talking to themselves for a very extended period of time. Yaya is mad. She's jealous. She's mad. No, you mad. Not me. No. Get back here, you little rat. Hey, what happened to yay? What happened? She mad. Why? I have an idea. Something about a cousin. I'm going to do something great. I've discovered that I don't care about their drama anymore. All right, I'm putting that there just for good measures. She is not going to see it. Oh, someone died over there on her next go around. She's going to come. I'm going to just go over here for now. All right. If somebody steps here, they die. One there. She just killed three people. Stop, please. All right. One there. You better remember it's there. You literally saw me put it. No. 

I doubt anyone's actually going to make it this far, but I put one right there just in case this girl might actually make it. She just left the game. All right. Also, don't go under here. Somehow, see, like that guy. Just jump on top of them. I'm up. Just back away for this part. Oh, God. You waited for your friend. I'm just going to start putting a million of them down just to see what happens. Oh, they're already exploiting for some oh, God. They're killing everyone. Well, guys, there's your parkour tower experience. If I'm in the server.

He wants to switch teeth. 
What? Juan. I drove you. I drove you here on the Donut truck. 
And now you're leaving us? 
Juan. 
How dare you? Juan. Shoot him. Draco. We're back here again in my favorite color, orange. I'm joking. We're back into jail because today Roblox Jailbreak has an update where there's tons and tons of more stuff. So we are going to be exploring it and breaking out of jail today. In a new style this time. 
Yeah. 
So supposedly now we can use another way to break out of jail. Not crawl under the fence like always and get electrocuted and thrown in jail. 
Under construction. 
I wonder what that could mean. Not like it. Wait, what do you mean under construction? 
There's nothing here. Except you can explode the wall. Wait, is anyone looking? 
No, just an appear. 
Okay, hold down e to explode the wall. 
Go. 
Yes. Wait, is there any car behind us? Okay, come on. Let's go. Let's go. We're running out of here. 
Oh, my gosh. Is that new? It's a SWAT car. 
Yes. 
That's kind of intimidating. 
There's also this new mini map so we can see where we're running. 
We escape. We better run quick. Oh, it's like GTA now. 
I like it. I think I saw a cop up there with a pistol. 
Whoa. Someone has a rainbow cop. It's a cop. 
It's a cop. 
Run. Run. Get in the car. Jump over. Jump over. Jump over. Get in. Get it. Drive. Drive, Draco. Get it. I'll run. Draco. Run. Gold, are you actually going to ditch Draco? We got to pick him up. 
Oh, no. 
Safe. Draco, are you on your cell phone? 
Yeah. Hello? 
Are you safe? 
Dude, this rainbow car. Hey, wait. This police officer said get in. Okay. 
What? It's a corrupted cop. Keep driving. Keep driving. Corrupted? I need to witness this. What do you mean witness what? 
Is he corrupted? Is he nice? Draco, ask him if he's a nice dude. 
He just said, Where do I want to go? And I just said town. 
What? No way. That is so cool. 
Wait, I think we can take oh, is that a Lambo? So we have this car, the plebi car. We're going to take our plebi car in here. Do you see that? There's a police officer in there. 
Yeah. Awkward fixing our car. 
Sure he is. So we can choose a texture for our car since we did play jailbreak when it was beta. And if you guys did, too, you get this free pixel texture, which is super cool. 
It's really nice. 
Oh, my gosh. It's 40 grand for a galaxy texture. That is too expensive for us. Let's go for scrolling on over. 
Oh, wait. 
Do you see this one? It's a doughnut. 
Oh, that one is so cute. This one makes me so hungry. 
I think I'll see the police officer outside your garage. 
Oh. 
What? 
He's trying to arrest me. 
Okay, I really don't want to go outside now. So we're going to go with the diamond texture. I really like it, but I also like the donut. We're going to go with the diamond. And let's get some rims for our wheels. Halo expenses. 
We'll camouflage while we're robbing diamonds. 
That's true. All right. Brakes. We're going to get in. How about we'll just use regular brakes for now? A high suspension. 
Whoa. That's so cool. Oh, it's so expensive, though. Is it worth that? You're going to be bigger than all the other cars. 
That's right. We're turning this pleb car into a big car. Let's see your tag here. Too fun. Oh, it's so too fun for you. And we have just paid $500 for it. The suspension will pay $2,500, and our car is ready. OOH, we can paint the wheels blue, can we? 
Yes. 
Or white. Oh, let's go with let's make blue. Yeah, let's do science. So we'll buy this. There we go. We're ready. 
Jacket. 
Was this safe out there? 
I don't know. Last time I was out there, a cop ran and handcuffed me. 
I feel like he's waiting. Tint your windows. 
Those are so cool. You're right. 
I really like it. Okay, you ready to drive? I'm scared. 
Drive. 
Oh, no. Hey, hey. Come on. Come back in. Get back in. Get back in before he comes back. Hey, dude, I'm shopping. 
What is it? 
No. He was captured. You poops. You poops over two fun cars. I just bought this car and I got captured. Oh, that is so cool. 
So I did customize it. Do you think the wheels look pretty dirty, though? 
Maybe we should change the car. No. 
I paid so much to get high suspensions. 
Whatever. 
Now we can drive on land without falling. Let's go rob our first bank without that cop. If you see that cop, we got to smack them in the back of the head. 
We got to go get weapons. That's true. 
We got to go get weapons. I like it. I like it. 
How do you like your wheels? I feel really tall in this car. 
I think we look super extra and ridiculous. 
Can you get a better car with more seats so I can sit in it, please? 
That's true. Can we get a truck? 
Yeah. 
If you see a truck, shout out it to me so I could go grab it. What is happening down here? Oh, my God. They all have lamborghinis. Lamborghinis with super 500. I will never have enough for 70K. But let's rob this jewelry store. 
Whoa. 
It's her car. 
Tacos like, come back. 
Who's a policeman? 
No, it's the police again. It's the police. It's the police. 
Okay, we're going. 
No, you guys don't get captured. I'll run him over. Go get in, buddy. Run. I'm getting out of here. 
Go to the outlaw. 
Go to the outlaw, buddy. Get vengeance for us. 
Oh, no, he's coming. 
I'm backing up. 
Don't apprehend me out of my poops. 
Poops, poops, poop. I found the truck. 
It's the truck we want. It is $9,000. Let's buy it. Should we buy it? Too late. I already buy. 
Really? I don't think Draco can fit in it. 
Draco can sit in the back and hopefully not get hit by the cop. What is this place? Is this a convenience store? 
We can rob this guy. Oh, okay. 
I'm just going to rob you now. 
Come on. Come on. Let's rob him. Hurry. 
Give me your money. 
Yeah. We obviously have no weapons, but we're scary, so give us your money. $50? Yes. 
That's all. 
Oh, wait. 
Can we grab 250? 
You got 250? 
Okay. Don't mind us. We're not doing anything. We're just standing besides your cash register and everything. 
They said I don't have any money. Don't come don't come back later. 
Okay, well, thank you for the money. I only got 50, but Gold got a lot. Draco, we have a truck. It is so cool. 
Can you come back and get me out? 
Okay, first off, let's pimp a truck. 
I like it. 
Super tall wheels. And let's make the truck go super fast. How expensive? 
50 grand. Ouch. 
All right. We're going to afford a level two engine. There we go. The brakes. And I don't care about brakes. Well, brakes are important, but right now, we don't really care. And the license plate says too fun. 
Hey. That's so funny. 
That is so trolley. We got this and the texture. Let's be more fun and not get a diamond, but let's be a donut car. 
Yes. Or should we brush it? Pink wheel. Yes. Away. 
I actually like this color scheme we got. There we go. Let's go. Draco, I'm coming to pick you up. 
We're going to save you. 
Enough donut truck driving back to the city. You want to listen to the radio? 
Yes. 
I'm joking. I don't have the radio edition. I'm scared that a cop is going to pop out of nowhere and murder you, Gold. Okay. 
I'm pretty sure a cop is going to pop out anyways because you're riding a donut fund. Oh, you're right. 
They love donuts. I'm joking. Dracco, where is the prison exactly? I'm on the lookout for it. 
A truck sticks out like a sore thumb. 
I am so sorry. 
What? 
I just flipped the truck. Oops. Okay, get back and get back. I'll unflip it. 
How do you unflip a truck? 
You cannot. We have to start pushing it. 
No, go. Push the truck. 
It's broken. Oh, poops. 
What do we do? We got to hop on the wheels. What? Oh, vy. You press V. Oh. 
You know why I was driving this way? 
Why? 
I see something majestical in the distance. I think it's a donut shop way. Is that a oh, my. 
What? 
It's 35 grand, though. I don't think we can afford this. Nope. Get back in the truck that everyone can sit in. Draco is going to meet us in the city, and we are still trying to find the villain hideout. We're having some trouble here because the map has changed. It's a lot bigger now. 
Yeah, it got super big. 
So where we go and go? Oh, wait, I think I see the camp. It's right there's. 
A helicopter? You're not allowed to go into camp. 
Sorry. I thought I could do some truck parkoa over this, but let's try this again. 
It's a place where you get weapons with helicopter landing. 
Okay, let's do it. Let's do it. 
But that's the scary cop girl that keeps getting everybody. 
How dare she drive her cop car into this camp? Okay, we have to sneak across some. Are you ready? 
Yeah, let's go. 
Let's go. Let's grab some guns and shoot her so she cannot murder us. 
Shotgun pistol, come get us. Yeah, come fight us. 
And take off these prisons clothes because they're so uncomfy and they're a little bit itchy all righty, girl who kept throwing us in prison twelve times. 
Where are you? Get out of here. 
Where is she? 
Oh, she lives at the criminal hideout. 
Yes, we're at the criminal hideout. 
Safeguard. Oh, gosh. Come on. Get back up here. What happens if she's down there? She's on murder. You're right, you're right. Oh, I see them. They're driving away. 
They're scared. Oh, wait, no. 
Yeah, you better run away. No, pal. 
Draco is going to meet us here. In the meanwhile, we will stand here. 
Hello? 
Draco, where are you? 
Welcome. 
Be careful, be careful. There's campers here. 
Do you see that helicopter? 
The PO posts are out. 
Yes, they're out to get everything and. 
They are very angry. Okay, did you grab your weapons, guys? 
Where do I get the weapons? 
They are inside the shop. We, Gold and I will be in the car right now. Get on board. Make sure there's no cop. 
I'm going to shoot anyone who comes. 
Near a donut, except for fellow villains. That guy's like, hey, go with me. 
Jump on the car. Jump on the donut if you want. 
Welcome to the Donut truck. 
Okay, so he wants to go to the jewelry store. Let's go to the jewelry store. 
Oh, now he's going to see my bad driving skills. 
Oh, someone has a swap card. 
That is so cool. We're going to the jewelry store. Let's go. 
Yeah. 
Don't we need a key card to do that? 
I don't know. Let's just shoot anyone who gets in our way. 
Okay, we're at the jewelry store. Let's do this. 
Hey, it's a cop. 
Where? 
Shoot him. 
There's no one here. 
Wait, it's a cop. It's a cop. Shooter. You are not handcuffing us. It's that same girl. That's what? Julie, it's the guest. It's the guest. Oh, no. That's right. 
We're sick of you guys throwing us in prison. We're so tired, so let's go in here. 
Wait. 
Oh, we got to climb up. We got to climb up. I think we did a very good job of clearing out those cops. Now we can crawl up these ladders and break into the jewelry store for monies. Let's go. Up the ladder. Do you see any cops around here? No. 
How do we get into the jewelry store? 
I think we need a key card. Maybe this due knows. 
Jump down. Oh, my god. It's a cop. 
It's a cop on the pair of shoes. 
Oh, they said, follow me. Follow them. 
Oh, they know where we're going. Nice. 
Okay, juan, let's go. Uh oh. 
Is that a police chopper? 
Oh, my god. She just fell out. She just fell. Please get him. No, not today. 
Yeah, so do they know where they going? Let's follow him. Oh, wait, there's some weapons. 
Picked up a key card. 
OOH, nice. Draco seems very excited. They picked up a key card. All right, open up these doors. 
Open them up, juan. 
Why? 
Open them. 
Juan. Juan. Juan, open up the door. We know you got the key. Key card. I don't think he wants to open it. 
It's a SWAT. 
Look at this girl. She's like, ah. 
Hey, SWAT. She's like, smacking the car to death. 
Wait, whoa. 
I think there's a SWAT person in the car. Oh, it's just a regular person. 
What to switch t's what? Juan, I drove you I drove you here on the donut truck, and now you're leaving us? Juan. How dare you? 
Juan. Shoot him, draco. Shoot juan. So he got the key card. I'm going to shoot him. 
Juan's beating up people because he doesn't want to share the monies. He's killing people. No. Hold on. Jack, go shoot him. He's gone mad, cat. 
He's invincible. 
There's a cop. No. When I can break you out, I. 
Can break you out. 
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Lost all my weapons. I'm useless now. 
You know what? Let's return to the bait. 
Get in, get in, get in. 
Let's go, let's go. 
No. Break me out. Break me out. 
Shoot that guy. 
Get it. Get in, get it. Get in, get in. 
We're going back to the jewelry store once we resupply. Let's go. Our plan is we need to get a key card from the cops. By killing the cops, right? 
Yeah. 
Okay, and so if we murder at least one police, we can get the key card and then a break. Open the jewelry store. Let's try this again. This time, we aren't teaming up with anyone. Okay? If someone says team, be like, no, we are a lone pack. We travel in three. 
Yes. Why? 
Why would you petraeus. 
Okay, opening anyone that comes near. Funny. 
Dragon, stop bringing our position. 
Dude, you're bringing out our position. Let's go. Do you think our truck sticks out? 
No, not at all. 
Okay, thank you. There he is. 
Get him. 
That one. That's rhett. Get both of them. 
Fellow prisoner. 
Oh, no. I got shot again. Help me. Help me. 
I'll break you out. I'll break you out. 
Can't get in the car. 
Get in the car. 
No, he got me. He got me. No. 
Funny. 
Break us out. 
We just got a key card and went into here and stole everything. Now let's get out of here. Print it out. 
What happened? 
Nothing. We just dressed. 
We are super duper triggered. Look at this person's. Like let me out. No, look. Gold glitching. Okay, gold right. She's just wobbling a cop. There's no cop here. Come on. 
There's a cop right in front of you. 
Should we be careful? Should we just shoot them? 
No, because then they'll know we have a gun. 
Okay, let's escape through this place because she doesn't know we have these weapons yet. Break down the wall. 
Come on out. Boom. Okay, go, go, go. 
I think someone saw us. 
It's okay to keep weapons. If anyone even tries to get close to us, shoot them down. 
Yeah, that's it. Don't come near us. Oh, and there's a car. There's a pool. There's choppers. There are choppers right there. Hopefully we have our truck. 
Run. Go back. 
It's a criminal. 
Run, run, run. Criminal caught out. 
We need to go back to our amazing truck. So let's go. Let's go. Over here. This time we will not fail. We have the perfect plan. Set it all out. We got a key card. Yeah, we got shotguns. Our goal is to heist that diamond store and no police is going to imprison us. We're going to shoot them down ASAP. Let's go. Okay, so first we're heading off to the roof, right? That's part of our plan. 
Yes. To the roof. 
Oh, wait, this is not the area. 
Funny. 
We're robbing. 
You're supposed to know the dinosaur. I know, I'm bad. 
Hey, I have a donut car. Don't. This is the area. Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go. Run, run. It looks like some blue person is already in there. 
Come on, draco. 
That's the bank. This is the bank. 
Oh, wrong police. 
There's a police. 
It doesn't matter. I want to steal money at the bank too. Ah, buddy. Help me. We gotta save Draco. 
Draco, there's a police. 
No, no. Gold. Shoot him. Shoot him. Gold, help me. Hurry. Bunny. 
There's another one. He's gone. 
Oh, draco's already? Oh, I lost Gold. Shoot him. 
Okay, I'll pick up this guy. 
I got your back, girl. Thank you. Stay away. Die. Die. Do we get a key card from him? Oh nice. 
A key card and a gun. 
That's what you get. 
Okay, let's go in here. Gold. We'll wait for Draco. But we're going to steal from the bank first. All the way down here. I like this. Gold. It is time for super secret agent owl. Super secret agent noises. Let's go. Oh, okay. We got some TNT, placed it around the door. And Kabul me exploding noises. 
Don't get hair by the laser. 
Okay, keep washing. A boom. Actually, it's taken quite a while to put on this TNT. But it's coming. 
Ow, buddy. Oh, monies money. Oh, I can upgrade my duffel bag. 
Be careful. We want to make sure that there's not a cop behind us. We're stealing everything we have almost $1,000 with full. Are we ready to get out of here? 
No. Where did that cop come from? No. 
You ever watched one of those movies where people break into a police station, grab all the Swiggity swag and walk out like bosses? Well, let's see if this works out properly. Breaking in. That's right. And grabbing the guns. 
We got a flashlight. We got a gun. 
I don't know why I need a flashlight. 
I am buying the SWAT gear so I cannot die. That's right. 
No way. 
That's right. I'm angry now. I got this with a bot, with Robucks, and we got these police gear over here, and oh, like we got a flashlight. 
I think the cops going to come over here. Are we ready? 
Wait, I think we can get a helicopter if we go up. 
Nice. It's okay. Key card open. Let's get to the roof. Let's get to the roof. 
Come on, come on, come on. 
Run, run. 
And hustle, hustle. Come on. 
There's no helmet. 
Here. 
Up here. 
Press this button. Up here. Go up here. Wait, there's no helicopter. 
No, someone took it. 
No. 
Old school styles. Let's go. We are taking the classic way out. Come on, let's go. 
Come on, come on. Get in the swap heart gold. Get in. I'm already in, girl. 
Oh, okay. 
Get in the back. 
Oh, no. Police man, shoot him. 
Shoot him. 
Do police man, shoot him. Okay, I don't know how we're supposed. 
To get out of here, but you. 
Need to shoot this cop immediately. 
I'm going to have to open the gate, though. 
Call again. What are you doing? You crazy. 
Oh, no. Oh, no. 
That's it. That's it. 
That's it. 
I got this. No. 
Get away. 
Get away from my friends. You I'm nice. 
No, you're not. I don't trust you. No, no, no. 
They always say they're nice. 
No. 
Just die. 
Go open the gate. 
I'm opening the gate. Here we go. Green button. Let's go. 
Bunny, you have to drive out. 
Okay, let's go. Let's go. 
Go. Get in the back. 
Get in the back. You can shoot people from the back. 
All right, who's ready to mess with us? Yeah. 
We look so cool now. 
Let's light. You better stay back. You better stay back. 
Jericho has a dangerous flashlight that he's. 
A flashy in the eyes. 
You think that's the best tactic, flashing someone in the eyes? 
Yeah. 
Oh, yeah. 
Let's be serious. We're going to heist the diamond. No more banks, no more nothing. I have bought an assault rifle. Nope, no more assault rifle. We're going to shoot some. We're going to shoot anybody that goes near us. Is this a diamond store? Diamond store. Here we are. Okay, let's go to the top. Be careful you don't want anyone following us behind us. 
Okay, go up, go up. No gold. Funny. Laurie, come on. 
Why did you abandon us? 
We are on this thing now because Draco is driving it and he is a dirty cop now. Because this is the only way we are going to get into the jewelry store. Draco, drop us off, land you right. 
On top of the building. 
You know what? We could actually parachute. 
Can we? Are we parachute styles? Parachute? 
Oh, al. 
No. She died. 
I'm heading to the top of the jewelry store, guys. And this time I won't fall off and break my legs with a parachute. Not really. Are you on the top? 
Yeah. 
That's it. The reigning moment to finally steal. 
Yes. 
Hey, buddy, you don't go in through this. Just go through the front. Someone already got one in. 
Oh, wait, draco, I'm going to pick one up to you, but you should not park your helicopter like this. 
Why? 
Buddy, you're the worst villain ever. You couldn't even fish. 
Okay, I have this ready and is there a cop? 
There's a cop down there. That dinosaur again. Buddy, behind you. 
I'm going to ask this free card. They said, here you go, ma'am. 
All this. So cute. 
Thank you, girl. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. After getting thrown into jail twelve times and playing this game for more than an hour to try to rob a jewelry store as it really means a lot to me this time. I don't know guys. You don't know how long we've been trying to rob this jewelry store for. It's been a while. It's been a while. This person is telling us to leave. You leave. 
You leave. 
You leave. 
You leave first. 
You leave first. I'm getting the halle. 
No, we're getting the halle. Go. Get on. Funny. Get on. Go, go. Drive. 
Why are you causing a problem just everywhere? 
No, he took it. You know what? We're just going to sit in here. He locked it. Oh, he's good. 
Okay, that was dramatic. Draco, we asked this person to stop us at the diamond store. Let's go. Okay, nice. Be careful. 
Careful. 
The mappy cops again. Let's go. Let's go. I have my card. 
Oh, my God. 
It's not working. 
How do you think he's supposed to shoot this glass? 
Wait in the car. 
Notch again. 
Okay, come on. Wait. You said we shoot this glass. 
I don't think you do. 
I don't know. 
That's how I saw other people get in. 
I have a key card. I feel like you have to use the roof access. 
Come on, guys, please. 
I don't want a cop to pop out of nowhere again and murder all of us. Let's go up here. So it turns out that you have to rob the bank before robbing the jewelry store. I think I remember that from one of our other episodes. Come on, let's go. This time we will actually rob the bank. Because there are more prisoners than they are cops. Keep an eye out, though. Someone has pushed me and I fell on my butt. Okay, keep an eye out, though. 
It's open. Let's go. 
Wait. Is he actually nice? 
No, he's not. 
What? Is he actually nice also? This is what the jewelry store looks like, as you can see. 
Funny. He arrested me. He's a liar. He's a liar. Liar. 
Okay, so this is not going very well. At least we got in the jewelry store. That's the best of it. We got in here. I'm pretty happy. Even though we got arrested, even though we did not ties to the jewelry store. I'm going to call it a day here. We've been playing this game for about an hour and 30 minutes now, trying to go into the jewelry store. But the cops are so good at this game. Being a villain, it's so hard. I'm just going to be a popo now. I'm just going to be a police. Oh, the team's fault. Corrupted police. Oh, the team's fault. Turns out I can't be a police. But if you guys did enjoy jailbreak. 
Make sure to smash the like button down below for villains. 
Because villains, we need some love. And it's very sad for us because we keep getting thrown in jail. Like, I cry every time. Can we reach 8000 likes? Maybe that will give us some good luck to rob the jewelry. Otherwise than that, don't forget to subscribe to our channel if you haven't already. And I and the other two will see you all in the next one. Bye, guys. 
Bye.

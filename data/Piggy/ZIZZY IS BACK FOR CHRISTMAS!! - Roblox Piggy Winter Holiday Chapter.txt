And Merry Christmas and Happy holidays to everybody. Let's go in. Oh, dude, that's so cool. Oh, that's cool. So that everyone get their presents for each other. Dude, that is so cool. Just give me five minutes. I'll be right back. Dude, that's so cool. It's like a little Christmas for all the Piggy characters. I need to find gifts for them all and fast. There's George. There's a zebra, Mimi. And then what's over here? Dude, look, ZZ is back. She's alive. And there's a giraffe sitting with this guy. But it's like, so dark. I can't see anything. Let me see if I lower the graph. Oh, no, that doesn't help at all. Oh, the piggy woke up. 

Okay, I got to leave. Hey, there's a shovel. We got a shovel. Can we shovel snow? Dude, it's so dark outside. Oh, man, it's actually oh, wait, what did I just shovel this? I think I just shoveled snow. So what's over here? Okay, we got a gift. So we need a book to get this gift. Oh, so we're putting dude, look. Oh, dude. Whoa, look at that monster. It's like an ice monster. Oh, dude, I got to get out of here. I got to get out of it. Please don't lead me to a dead end. I'm in Amaze. Oh, no. Oh, dude, I don't know how I just survived that. Dude. I'm literally in amaze right now. I got to get out of here. All right, what do we need right now? So nothing. Oh, did I crouch? Okay, yellow key. Oh, shovel. Do I got to shovel all the snow? Probably. Dude, this monster needs to leave me alone. Dude, got to shovel. Oh, I got oh, I got the book. I got the book. Okay, let me bring this back. So let me bring this back here. So close this. Bye, guys. Bye, guys. Close that. 

Oh, dude. Yeah, close that. So bring this so I should be able to get the first present. Wait, why do I only have three minutes? Wait, this is so fast. You only have three minutes to complete this whole thing. A book about optics. Mimi will be looking for this. Do I grab it? Oh, I probably bring it to Mimi. Okay, well, I only have two minutes left. I literally only have two minutes left. Oh, man, why is this so difficult? Mimi, I got it. Here you go. Take it, take it. Mimi, please. Where do I bring this? Oh, I put it in the Christmas tree. Okay, that's super cool. All right, let's look for something else. So we got all of these houses. There is a white key here, so I did see oh, there's a toy right here. So I did. See this? There's a present with a carrot. So I'm going to grab this toy here and then nothing here. Dude, I'm running out of time. This is way too fast, bro. This is so fast. Christmas, this is just like Christmas. It just passes way too fast like before, you know, when Christmas is over. 

It's so sad. All right, we got to find okay, there's a shovel. We got to find something else. So what is this? This is like a snowman. What's over here? Oh, we found the old carrot. We found the carrot. We found that sword earlier. I'm going to come back for that sword. So it's kind of like a speed run type of game. All right, we got a speed run, so we're probably going to have to play this a few times to get it, but this is pretty cool. So bring this here. So bring this here. Pony loves carrots. All right. Oh, dude, this guy's coming. All right, let me go here. Okay, the sword is right here, so I got to grab that later. I only have a minute left. What is this? Like, how do you complete this with 1 minute left? Oh, no. Okay. Bring this to Pony. All right. Bring this to the tree. Okay, there you go. All right, now I got to get that sword. That sword, I got to go for it. You really got to speed run this. I think you got to play this a few times. Maybe it's faster with other people. I should probably try it with other people. 

All right, got the sword. And then now the sword thing. It should be straight ahead, but I have 30 seconds left. Dude, this is way off. Dude, nothing is following me. This is way too fast. Let me go through here. Let me see what we got over here. So we got this, and then ZZ and her sister will definitely use this fencing. Okay, dodge that. All right, so I got to look for other presents. Now I have, like, literally no time. Oh, I got to shovel that. I got, like, no time left. Bring this. Oh, Hanukkah. Did I lose? No. Did I lose? Do I seriously have to get all of that in five minutes? That is so insane. Okay, let me try this on multiplayer, and then before I do, let's check out the new skins. So over here, we got no new skins. We got Mr. P over there. No new skin skins extra. All right, here there's a reindeer skin. Okay, let me equip that. Okay, let me go on multiplayer and see how well I do. Okay. Winter holiday select. 

Hopefully everybody selects it, but guys, if you haven't done so, like I said earlier, destroy that like button. Destroy that like button right now and then I guess give us a Christmas update. Here you go, guys. Boom. On the screen right there. You guys can have those. First come, first serve. All right, let's go. Bot mold. Don't go on infection. Infection is crazy. Please don't pick infection. Let's go. Bot mold. We got to go this. We got to do this as fast as possible, and then after I do this, I'm going to try to do it by myself so that everyone get their presents for each other. All right, I got to go fast, so I got to get everybody's present. Just give me five minutes, and I'll be right back. Dude, you should have said ten minutes. You should have said ten minutes. Okay, let me see. Find the gifts for snowing again. So there must be a way to make it not snow. I think that might be, like, a trick to make it not snow. Okay, let me see. There's a present. Okay, there's a carrot. So to get that carrot, we need the white key. There's a top. All right, I got the carrot. I'm showing the guy that I have the carrot. 

Did someone grab the shovel? The shovel is right here. The piggy woke up. All right, go, go, go. We need a shovel. We need a shovel. So what's over here? What's this present? I'm going to go fast. Okay. What is this present? So this one is oh, did someone just grab it? I think someone just grabbed it right before I got to see it. Someone just yanked it before I got to see it. Let me go in here. Did someone grab this? All right, I'm going to grab this sword. I think this is useful. Someone did grab oh, shovel, shovel. That's useful. We have a thing over here. Thing here. Let me see. I got the sword, so I know this goes somewhere. I know this goes right forward. I think it's right here. So I just got to know where the spinny top is, and I got to know where the toy for George is too. All right, there you go. Fencing. So we got that one, and I'm going to burn this to the Christmas tree. We are going to do it, guys. 

Hey, guys, what's up? There you go. There's a gift. I told you I was going to bring it. I told you I had it the whole time. Now we're going to go back and oh, it doesn't snow. So I guess if you get a certain, like, how far you get, it stops snowing. All right, we got to start shoveling here. All right, what are we going to find now? What do we got to find? I got the shovel. I'm not even sure if we still need a shovel, but hopefully we do behind this. Oh, you know what? This kind of looks like ZZ. This kind of looks like ZZ a little bit. Let me see. Nothing over here. Something over here for me to shovel. I think I got it at the wrong time. Yeah, I don't really need this anymore. Yeah, rip all the guys right there. All right, ready? Boom. Ah, man. Let me look here. I feel like they beat the game. They beat the game already. No, the carrots. No. 

Where is all this stuff? Dude, I feel like we did oh, look, the guy stuck over there. Then we already beat the game. Honestly, feels like we got everything. This map is really small. I wonder why Mini Tools made such a short map that he rush it. I feel like this might have been rushed, like the map is so small, and then no one did only have five minutes. All right, let me go check. Hello? Guys, did I win the game? Did we win? Oh, we won. We won. You won't believe what just happened. Some weird creature was chasing me the whole time. I don't even know how I just won it. Did any of you guys see it? I even ran to the cabins with it behind me. It's strange we didn't see that at all. Also, did you run out and find a present for all of us? Yeah, we did. Look, what matters is we're all together. I agree. So now that we're here, let's exchange gifts. Okay. That's pretty cool. 

Okay, so thank you so much for the carrot. Grumpy. Gravy. I'll try my best to save it for later. He's going to eat it right now. And I absolutely love this book. I'll be reading it over and over for a while. I'm glad you like it. A fancy foil. Now just be like ZZ. Behzi and be careful to share that with with Z until we get another one. Thank you so much. Grumpy. Gravy. This is just like the one back home, and it means so much to me. George is so sad. Come here, everyone. Let's go play. Happy holidays, everyone. Oh, guys, ZZ is back. ZZ's alive for Christmas. All right, let's try to speed run this by myself. Okay, here we go. We got to go fast. We got to go fast. We got to go fast. We got to go fast. Okay, we got the yellow key. I'm going to use this. Open that. I am not going to use the shovel first. I'm not sure if that's a good idea, but I'm not going to use the shovel first. I have no idea if that's a good idea, but I'm going to use the white key to open everything. 

And is there a key here? Okay, so this should open the carrots. I got to be fast. We only got five minutes. I'm going to go back here. This gives me the sword. So the sword is straight ahead, so I'm just going to go straight ahead. And I got my Alt as a bot, so it should not attack me, so I don't have to worry about that. All right. So it should be over. Okay, I got to watch out for this. Turn that in. Boom. Okay, the carrot is right there. And then we got this one, which is I don't know what this one is. Oh, this one is a spinny thing, which I have no idea where it is. Oh, no. Okay, wrong room. This one right here. And then grab the carrot. I got to grab the carrot. Grab the carrot. Boom. Nothing there. Okay, so there's nothing left in this area. There's nothing left on this side. I can be okay leaving this side. I just got to get the shovel. Now shovel up everything. 

So bring this over here. So nothing there. So bring this here. But this year, grab this for Pony. Okay, we got two presents. Now I'm going to grab the shovel. Now, this is where I grab the shovel and shovel everything. Here you go. And then now we got to shovel everything. Where does the shovel boom. Start shoveling everything. Boom. Nothing. We got three minutes left. Well, like, around three minutes left. That's nothing. Boom. Okay, there's a book. Oh, I know where the book goes, so I'm going to leave the shovel there. I don't know if I still need it. There might be something under this. Let's go. Go, go, go. Bring this to the book. Boom. Get this. I don't know if I still need the shovel. Dude. I think I need the shovel. I got to go back for it. I'm just going to go back for it just in case. I don't even know where did I even leave it? I don't even know where I left it. Let's bring this here. All right, where did I leave the shovel? Now? That's the question of the day. 

Right here. Grab that. I don't even know if I need this, but hopefully two minutes left. Two bedrooms, shovel, everything. I'm so stressed. I can't lose this. I'm so stressed. Less than two minutes. Do I still even need a shovel? That's a question. Okay. Oh, toy, toy, toy. We got the toy here. This goes in here. So the spinny thing might be in here. The spinny thing might be in here. I don't know where, but I feel like it's in here. All right, let's go. I think it's over there. All right, let me go. So bring this here, and then okay, one more toy. I need a spinny thing. Please tell me it's in here. Please tell me it's in here. Yes. 1 minute, guys. 1 minute. Dude, I can't find the exit. I can't find the exit. I can't find the exit. Oh, man.

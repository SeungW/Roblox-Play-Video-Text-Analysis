Hey, guys. It's Korean. Tarak inside. Roblox. And today we are back inside restaurant tycoon two. We are back here with my restaurant. It's called Korean's pizza, even though I also sell Spanish food and French food. But, you know, whatever, we like it that way. So this guy wants some tutorials. Turios. What? All right, guys, so we're chilling here. Our thing is like, oh, surf customers. Oh, fast. Come on. Yours don't have your Cheerios yet. Like, what? Why are you taking so long to eat your Cheerios? That makes a sense. He hasn't even got his Cheerios. Why does he look like he wants to rob this place? Like what? New orders. Got to cook fast. Click rapidly, rapidly, rapidly. Cook. Cook. When I'm making I'm making ballet. Bayella, bala, Bayala, whatever you matter. Put lots of sauce on it. 
Got to make more food. Make more paella. Palea paella doesn't even I can't even pronounce it. I don't even know how it's supposed to be pronounced, but I kind of get it, I guess. I don't even know. Yeah, we only have 30 seconds. Land a s in the mess. D in the mouse. Come on. 30 seconds. So I got to cook this pizza. People are still ordering pizzas here? What some people ordering, like, French salad. Do I have that? Is that a thing? I don't know. Hey, someone left here. Get the pizza, guys. Finish. Yay. Clay 25 bonus cash and a lunchbox day. Steven all right, collect me my money. 
Open my lunch boxes. What time is it? It's time for lunch. Macaroons. What? I love macaroons. Oh, my gosh. I got my ticket. Yes. Oh, that's awesome. What's in this lunchbox? Lasagna. I don't really like lasagna. I got another ticket, though. Yeah, it says that here. I got two tickets, but it's only one. Oh, wow. Table for four. What? Madam. What? Okay. Can you sell walls? Is that, like, a thing? I think I need to buy more property or I need to move some of these areas back a little bit. All right. I'm going to close my restaurant close so my workers will just stop working eventually so I can move things around easier. 
I want to extend the plot. I have enough money to extend it, but I don't know if I want to. I'm going to want to move the kitchen back a little bit. Move there. I can't move this right now. I can't delete this item right now. No, it's fine. It's fine. Everything what? This guy is a good rock car. How are we looking to get in if there's a car right in front of my restaurant? What? Talk about bad parking. Pizza and Bowmanes. People are still ordering that kind of stuff. One lasagna. And I should probably help cook because there's a lot of things to cook and I'm not helping at all. 
D, click on lasagna is a cooking. I don't even know how to make lasagna. Don't know how it's made. Come on. Got cooked. Making spaghetti bolognese. Making the bolognase pasta. The boiling pasta is boiling. Why is this girl standing right in front of me while I'm cooking? I don't like it. It's weird. She's pushing me away from my workspace. I was putting sauce on her head, if you like that, and it's short, but I don't know. It's okay. Come on. Lasagna is a cooking. Why do I have to put in there? 
If I'm cooking it in the oven, maybe I put in pot and then I put in an oven. I don't know how long lasagna has made. I have no idea. But I don't really care, honestly. All right. Do you click. Making the balloon spaghetti bolognese. Okay. Left and right. Putting sauce on her head. Girl, I don't really know why you're into that kind of stuff. Okay. I'm not here to judge. Oh, the guy just made cheese pizza. Macarons money. Yes. I love that money. Money is delicious. Exit build mode. Isn't this place closed or so I set the clothes just now. I know. I think it was always closed. Hopefully these guys are just about to leave. 
Okay, that's good. I got the same exact place as I got last time, so that's nice. I'm going to see if I can get more cuisines. I got three tickets. Okay. So I want to get something really out there, like, wow, like crazy. Oh, I wanted to get Greek food. I want to get all the European stuff, like everything that's kind of European. Italy. I don't think it's in Europe, but maybe it is. I don't even remember it anymore. But we're going to get Greek. Reese. Yeah. All right. Yeah. I've got Greek food. It's going to be okay. We got pizza, bread. Got skewers and whatever that is. Okay, awesome. You got Australia and Hungarian food. I want German food. I could also get that. German food. Hey, what do we get? 
We got raw, worst, snit, jills, and pretzels. Pretzels are German from German. I didn't know that. I guess I could sort of pronounce these names, sort of because I got a polish accent a little bit. And I can make an accent, a little bit of an accent, like a polish accent. And I guess it helps, but I can't really pronounce it that well. Anyways. Okay, move. There we go. It's a bill mode. All right, open. There we go. Guys, do your thing. I'm going to Ikea. Ikea. What? Okay. All right. I'm not really thinking about furniture at the moment. Is this one cheaper? Oh, no, it's not cheaper. I thought it might be, but no, it's not. I'm just going to keep on getting these ones because these are pretty good. 
I'll get two more. 234-1234? Yeah, eight of those will be fine. Yeah. All right. I kind of want to get one more kitchen, so I might get one more and get a fringe. Okay, it might be a little bit of decoration. Just a little bit of decoration. What kind of decoration should we get? I don't really know. Let's go up a floor. There's a new floor up here. There's another floor. Not a new floor. I think the floor was always here. Welcome to my restaurant. Okay, we got different signs. That's pretty neat. Got this lamp. That is cool. We got different flags. They don't have all the flags. 
Whatever. All the flags that I have in my restaurant. Oh, I have some new, very vibrant plants. They're so vibrant, I might go blind. Oh, my gosh. We got toilets. Okay, sure. Do people actually use them? That's so cool. Get plants. Okay. I want to get a TV. Should I? I think I'm going to save you don't really need a TV. Yeah, we don't need a TV. All right, let's go back. Teleport. Teleportation. Why is I shuffled there now? Oh, yeah, because we moved it. He had to move or something. I don't even know. Yay. Awesome. Day seven. Oh, I missed the thing or whatever. I forgot to see how much I got. It doesn't really matter. All right, these ones, I think, are almost finished. Let's open my lunchbox. What did I get in my lunchbox? Oh. I got Calamari from Greece. 
And one more ticket. One more cuisine ticket. Beautiful. What kind of lunch boxes can we get? Is there, like, gold lunch boxes? Can I buy more lunch boxes? Why is that not a thing? Why can't I buy more lunch boxes? Okay, whatever cool. All right, I'm going to build all right. Fridge and stuff like that. Will do later because I don't quite have enough room now. I don't know why I bought them, but I did. I don't know how to place these exit build mode. All right, I'm going to close the restaurant. So everyone's going to leave eventually. And also I'm going to go I need to buy more property. I'm going to go to the wall store. Is that a good idea? 
I don't know. I don't know anymore. Oh, maybe we can make it like, a corner kitchen. That'll be so cool. Waldo. Look on, Waldo. All right. Yeah, I'm going to do this corner kitchen. This is going to be so cool. I can't move this item right now. Okay, come on. Wait, I need to move. Oh, I got to put it here. It's on the glass. It's not ideal. We're going to have to work it. Whatever. It's fine, it's fine. Everything is fine. It's fine, it's fine. Hang an exit building here. 
Yeah. Live. If I wait a little for chef wow. I'm going to help cook a little bit. I think I want to get another chef. Well, I kind of need to get another chef because I got a never thing. I never cook. Think place. I also should get another waiter, but I think my waiter is doing a pretty good job. It's just a cooking that's a little slow. Beautiful. I've got to get these customers out of here as fast as I possibly can. Why are people watching me cook? It make me feel uncomfortable. Making split spaghetti. bolognase. The bolognase. Making the bolognase. bolognase left and bright and boom, boom, boom. Oh, gosh, we got so many orders. We got lasagna. Click. Oh, my God. 
Name me my money. I need my money where I can eat all the walls. No, but that won't look as nice. Money. I love me some good old money. Maybe I could place some of the tables and chairs. Now. I realized now why I didn't do it before because I didn't really have much room. But now I guess I could. I don't like how it's so in the corner. I'm going to move it some picky like that move there. 
And then I'm going to get another dining table, some more chairs. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Another dining table? Yes, I know. Another one. Another one. Oh, no, cancel that. Yes, I know it's a little crazy. It works. It works. It's fine. Wait, we could move this. Put it against here. I know it's not the best, but it'll come together and I'll put the middle. Fridge is tiny. Does it look tiny? Looks tiny to me. No. 
Have the fridge here. All right. We're going to have this here. Yeah, we could have two more in the middle because that would fit kitchen or maybe not two more. Yeah, I'm going to put how did I put this? I forgot where R was. Right there. So I'll put that one there. I'll put this one there and this one next to it. That's what's going to happen. That's the deal. I cut so many kitchens everywhere. Oh, my gosh. All right. I don't have any customers here. Zero customers here. Like, wow. Okay. Yikes is fine. 
Everything is fine. All right. Making food, making food, making food, making food, making food. Come on. Ready? Faster, faster. This is dessert. So they're leaving now. Okay, good. You're about to have dessert. It's good. All right, take the macaroons. There we go. All right. Store and store and store. Okay, I'm going to move put there. Move. I would like to have a pole here. That would be cool. Glass. Where did this come from? Yikes. All right. 
It's fine. I'll get eventually some kind of plant to put in this corner. This is how you get into the kitchen. Yeah, looks good. You don't want to put this table over here. Lunchbox. I got zero bonus cash. Well, that's what I get for not doing anything. It's fine. At least I got a lunchbox. I mean, lunchboxes are right. I changed my mind. I want to move it this way. I know. I'm changing my mind a lot. Okay. I'm just going to put this all here to make it my life a little easier. All right. I could put this here, but I'm not going to make it. A little bit farther, brother. 
Give them a little extra space. All right, there. We could have a smaller table here. This will be the two table. Eventually I'll move this one because I think customers are sitting there. I want to collect my cash. All right, where did the macarons go? All my chefs have stopped. All my workers have stopped. They don't know what's happening. I think, dude, you just have to leave because no one knows what you want anymore. Everyone is so confused. Can this chef even use this? The orders have been taken. 
I can't cook it. Can I just get rid of their table? I can't do anything with this item at the moment. You know, it's fine. I'm going to put everything in the store or dining table. My little old dining table. I'm changing my mind again. Okay. Store. Store. I can put my dining table down again. It's going to be here. I think that one store. Is it going to be there? Yeah, it's going to be there. Store. Store. 
All right. My small dining table. My other small dining table, it's going to go there. All right. I'm going to place all my chairs down. Finally. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm changing my mind. I don't like making decisions. It's hard. I put all these down. I guess we got another table. It's fine. Exit bill mode. Somehow get this person's macaroon. I don't know how. Maybe if I reopen the store because maybe they think that the store is closed, and they just I don't know. Okay. That's why I'm set to open. I hope I won't have to do all this myself. Maybe if I get at least one order, I make it myself. I'll give it to him, and he'll leave, and then you guys all and freeze. My waiter did not move a muscle. 
Yikes. Well, I put them in the four seater. In the four seater table. I forgot to give them this. One a chair. Tapas. One a tapas. Chef is doing something good. Waiter ain't doing nothing. Go. I'm paying money for this. I'm sorry. What? Okay. My waiter isn't so happy. Maybe if I give her a new do. I don't really like any of these hairs. What's the thing? This hair is all right. Maybe it could have tad darker. Why not? Exit settings. Are you alive? Tapas. Who's going to give them their tapas? Hello. Who's going to give them their tapas? No one's making the macaroons either.

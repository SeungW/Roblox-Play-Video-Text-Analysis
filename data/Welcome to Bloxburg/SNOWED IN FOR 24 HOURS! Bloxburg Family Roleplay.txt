Amber? Yeah. Come in here a SEC. I can't make any food. No, it's urgent. Urgent. I can't, I can't. It's a snowstorm coming here quick. 70 miles an hour. Winds, a load of snow, freezing temperatures. Come in tonight. Tonight. How much food have we got? How much food have we got? This is actually last time I was supposed to go to food shopping tomorrow. Okay. There's going to be a lot of people going to the shop. We need to go then. We need to get look. Oh, my well, I can't believe it. I can't take my eyes off the TV. Okay, well, make breakfast. I'll do is go straight away. All right, I'll get the kids ready. You maybe finish up. Okay, kids. Come on, guys. I'll leave. Hi. Hi, babies. Good morning. There's going to be a storm. It's already snow at the moment, but apparently it's going to be a lot of snow later on. 

So we've got to hurry up, eat our food. No, too much snow. Ollie. 70 miles now. Winds, they said to me, dangerous snow. We got no food in, so we're going to have to eat this quick and then we're going to have to go to the shop. That's probably going to be a lot of people trying to get a lot of food, though, who do have to be queer. Thank you, Anne Barry. That is quite all right. Thank you. Thank you for the dirty dish. I just loaded the dishwasher. Right, everyone go and put their turn this on. Dishwasher is going to be on whilst we go. We have important things to do. Okay. Take this very seriously. It's been very important. We're going to quickly go upstairs. Everyone get ready. Dressing something very, very warm. If we're going out, it's cold because it is fast because we don't be caught in the storm in our car. So everyone hurry up, put your clothes on and let's go. We need to get ready in, like, less than ten minutes. Everyone. I put a shovel, a few torches, and a few blankets in the back of the car just in case we get snowed in. 

Okay, good job. Good job. Okay, we're ready to go? Yes. Why? I've got to drive very carefully, though. We're very sleepy on the roads. Everyone ready? Maybe turn the fire off. Maybe back in a bit. Whose gokart is this? Why you park your gokart in front of the car in a rush? I wanted it ready. I can't hold on. Let me put on the road. I'm coming out. Oh, you grabbed the baby, I think. Me too. Careful, Amber. It's going to be slippy. I know it is. Oh, my gosh. The ice is slippery. Look up. It's night. It's so dark too. So dark. This is scary. It is becoming Blocksburg. River is going to freeze. 

Oh, my gosh. Maybe you might do we can go ice skating. We can. We can. It'll be a storm. Oh, yeah, true that. No one's about so quiet. Everyone knows Santa's still there, though. Santa. Santa. There's a snow storm happening. Okay. Get back to North Pole. It's pretty worse up there. He's on a summer holiday here. We've got time for good parking. Get out, sir. All right, I think we need at least two of these. All right. Beans. But beans are good to stock up on. They last for ages. Hands are important. We need a lot of water. Bananas don't last long, but, well, we can make banana bread with it when they go a little bit bad. That's the good thing about bananas. Get the green ones, because then we just know they'll be there for a while. I got way too many beans. How much money do we have? We got enough. Yeah, we got enough. We got enough. Everyone ready? 

Yeah. This guy's coming out in a snowstorm with a T shirt that says, I don't care. I don't care about your snowstorm. You need to care. You need to care about what's going on. And that's what goes like lack of boss. You don't care against some money. Please wait your turn. I'm Barry. I need to make my money so then I can pay for my shopping. Oh, my gosh. I did it wrong. He's so angry. That's you that'll be 42 85, please. Okay. There you go. Thank you very much. I scan mine as well. Quick, everyone to the car. There we go. Is there anywhere else we need to stop off? I think we're good. We could go to the nightclub one last time. We could party for the last time. People still line up the burger thing. Come on, guys. Get to your home. I know, 70 miles an hour. Wind is coming soon, and you're trying to get a double cheeseburger with fries, no onions. That blossoman. He likes it when it's cold. 

What about your gocart? I'll I'll park it up in the garage. Job. Oh, no, no. Almost be too chilly. Could get inside. Guys take hire. It's okay, kaya. You gotta turn the heating on. We were all nice and warm and here now. Oh, did you bring the shopping in? Yes, all in the fridge. All right. I think we stocked her. We may be eating beans for the next three weeks. That's all I could afford. He's a key me. I will be okay. Does she need to change him? I don't think so, Olive. Oh, it's really starting to snow now. Yeah, it's picking up. It's getting loud outside. Is Bella needs to go to the toilet. 

Oh, yeah, I didn't think about that. I should have another toilet inside. Okay, we'll lay some max out for her. I should be all right. She known before when we don't want it to. Oh, my gosh, it's so loud now. Yeah, it really is. This is sounding really bad. Yeah, it's getting really loud outside. It takes me I think? I think we should get somewhere safer. They come through the windows in the glass. Yeah, good point. And the glass is shattering. Okay, where's the baby? It takes me and we're going to have to get underneath something. Okay, everyone try and stay to the table. I'm trying. My head is too big. Amber is 
 
everyone okay? Yeah, I think so. The electric go. Yeah, the electric is gone. It sounds like it's calmed down a bit as well. A little bit. Do we dare have a look? We're safe. I think we can have a little look. Come on, Bella. Oh, my gosh. Look at the window. Olive whoa. Maybe I can open a door. Try it. My goodness. Can't even leave because the snow is all up to there. Oh, my gosh. What we could do is put out all of our food. 

We'll open the door, make a little hole, freezer. Oh, my gosh. That's a good thing today. What's? Gone as well? Yeah, it's gone. They just put all our food outside to chill all the beans. We can't watch sand. What are we going to do? Have we got any matches? Yes, we do. I have torches, but I put them in the car. Oh, no. Hold a minute. I'm ready. I couldn't plant this on make a fire. So now we can be all warm toasty. Everyone huddle around the fireplace. Oh, I'm chilly. Oh, chilly. What are we going to do for dinner? I don't know what we're going to have for dinner. What are you eating? A small. Good idea. Keep the blood sugar up. I'm going to see if I can make us something that we don't need the cook up for. I'm not changing my warm clothes. I'm freezing. Oh, you're not that cold. The fireplace. Right. It's so dark in here. Oh, it's okay. Still so scared from here. 

Look. Wow. It's all up to our swing set. No, my gokart. Not I parked in the garage, but did I close the door? I can't remember. Close the door to the garage, otherwise the car is going to be full. I don't think my car would even come up to this. Oh, no. Oh, my gosh. The pool. It was already iced by then anyway. But still helpful. Is anyone out there? There. Right. Let's see what I can make for the family. That's quick. Well, we have a banana that doesn't need to be anything. That bananas. Good to eat. Anyone wants? Yes, please. Harry anyone wants that? No, that's for the snowman. Oh, the snowman must be basically gone now. This is a snow block. No, he'll be fine. Yes. I'd like to go to work. 

Anything. We can have cereal or cereal for the family. It's so dark in here. A nice nutritious meal. Exactly. Who wants the first bit of cereal? I just had a bananas. That's your dollif. Here you go. Thank you. Thank you, Annberry. It's okay. Here we go, gals. Here is your bottle. And here is your bottle. Not too bad for babies. At least they just have milk and baby food. Which doesn't need any of the electric. Yeah, they're fine. I don't know anything's changed. What should we do to entertain ourselves? Since we don't have any electric and little stuck inside together? We could sing Christmas songs. Christmas tree. Oh, Christmas tree you don't know what you mean to me nice. Okay, let's not do that. What do you mean? 

What other things could we do? Have you guys heard of lost r beethley hem? It's like only star r berthley hem. I don't know the rest done. How about we play a game? Yes. Let's play Simon Says. Yes. Okay. I'm the best of this. Okay. I'm going to be Simon. Right? Simon says becky dance. Easy on the best Simon says player in the world. The babies are out. I'm sorry. You could not babies could not becky, dance. Simon says sit down. How do I won. You talking about western. We're both celine. I sat down first. Yeah, but that would mean it was only one round and that would not be a good thing. No. 

Sorry, Olive. I didn't say Simon Says. Oh, Billy. Billy. A chicken one. Yes. I didn't like this game. Okay. We don't have to play anymore. Okay, so guess what I am. Ballerina? No. A queen. Yes. I'm so good. Charades. I'm a queen. Guess what I am. Guess what I am. Oh, no. Hungry? You're hungry? You're a marshmallow. Yes, I am. You're a dancer? No. A singer? No, I was a K pop artist. Are you kidding me? Yes. Same thing as pop star. Yeah. 

Oh, I didn't hear that. Sorry. Went in. Your turn with chicken. All right. This one's me. A good one. Basketball player. Player. No. Just kidding. Yes. You both got at the same time. Yay. I think that we should probably go to bed now, everyone. Hopefully by tomorrow the electric will be sick. Come on, babies. Really tired. All right. Good night, everyone. Oh, my gosh. Look at it from upstairs. Look at the hill. Look how high it is. We might be here for a while, guys. Yeah. Wow. Look at it. It's so high up. We're glad they didn't smash the windows. Yeah. It's still mine. Love you. Good night. Love you. Good night. The chicken. The snow is melting. Yeah. Hello? I'm awake. 

Hello. Yeah, I must have heated up a lot overnight. Yeah, it's because the temperature must be a lot warmer. I like to run. I like to run. Only chick back. We're not snowed in anymore. Look, we can see outside. Front door still snowed in. Oh, my gosh. Yes. This is a test. You're ready? I can see that it's not through the windows. Yes. I think there's a garage door. Look, my door car. And that car is safe. Good. That's good. I've been really annoying to clean. Oh, it's still pretty chilly, though. I'm heading back inside, guys, right now. The snowman fine. Snow blast. No. Who was that? Who's there? Getting inside before they're throwing another one at us? I'm so sorry, Ollie. 

That was supposed to be a chicken. Chicken. All right, Amber. Now the electric's on, I'm going to make us the best breakfast ever with these chairs back to.

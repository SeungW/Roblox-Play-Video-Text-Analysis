Okay. Dom Q. Please don't queue. Please. I don't understand. She did the domcue. She's getting hurt. Welcome to the Tower of Hell. This place is going to make us cry. Will we beat it? Hooey hooey. Who we no probably swear. Guys, this is the most requested game for all of us. And I know who's going to cry first. I don't want to point fingers. Where are we going? The wrong way. I can't point fingers. Character. Oh, draco's in the lead. All right, Draco just died. So our goal here is to get to the top of this without dying. And there is no checkpoint, so it is rage inducing. I got this. This is so easy. You cannot walk. No, I want it to be funny. 
You guys, it's the first level. Come on. I know, I know. It's just blue. Blue is my jam. Okay, how do we have only six minutes to do this? Okay, I just need to practice my jumping jacks. I got this. Watch. It's just hot mask skills, everyone. No jack. 1212 bam. I got this. Hey, Gold. Go faster. Go faster. Come on, you can go ahead. You play so slow. Like this. See? This is low and steady. What the race guys, they're like, no, I just saw her fall. Oh. Who made it to the lily pad level before two of the other members? Oh, seems like it's. Rainbow. Okay, go, go. You have three minutes. I took her rate at this game. 
Wait. Lunar and Gold go. I'm scared. I'm scared. You quit. I don't think this oh, heck no. Come on, Gold. You got to do it. You got to do it. Do it. For the gram. All for the gram. For the gram. No, no, I can't you just go. I just want to see if you can make it to the end. You only have three minutes. You can't stand there. Gold, no pressure. Just go. Gold. Okay, do it. Do it for the YouTube. All right, so that's my turn. I'm so scared. Why is this rotating so fast? This is amusing. Guys, make sure to smash the like and subscribe right now so I don't cry later. Thanks. It's too late. She cried. I'm already crying. 
Hut pain. I'm so pro I'm so pro I'm so proud. I'm so pro I'm so pro no. That's horrible. I'm wasting robot. Look, I see your arm. Wait, what's invincibility no. Do not excuse me. You can shop. No. But I don't know what it is. That's not true. Skill. How do I get these points? Oh, I think it's from beating the game. I don't think you can't buy coins you can't buy to win in here. No way. You could pay 30 Robucks for checkpoints. Oh, you gave everyone double jump for, like, what, two months for everyone? Wait a minute. Thanks to the two minutes of nothing. Wait, what? Out my face. Wait, this is so weird. It's auto jumping, not helping. 
You just savage. Why is it working for me? Why did you put bunny hop on? I didn't know. I just trolled myself. It just makes everything hot. Bunny hop is not nice. Why am I winning then? Do you guys see all the stuff she bought up there? What are those three? What is she buying? She brought a checkpoint. She brought bunny hop. And she brought double jump. It's impossible. Okay, this is really bad. I want to delete this. Can we turn it off? Please? Turn it off. No. Okay. I guess we're going to die. Don't belong in towers. A new towers to buy. Okay. Do you want me to buy a double jump? I'll buy this. No. Double jump. Thank you. Double jump good for this. And last, but not least, double coins for everyone. They're perfect. Wow. It's great to have a whale in the game when you're doing this. Wait, where are we going? 
Up. You're going up the wall. I don't know if double jump health does. Double jump health? Yes. Watch this. Whoa. Drackle is crazy. He's trying to cheat. Look. I got this. Lunar, why are you so scared? I don't want to get whacked by this mechanism. Lunar, all you have to do is believe and learn very fast. Go, Lunar. Go, Lunar. Don't stop for nobody. I'm running. I'm running. Get out of my way. Downy. Rainbow. No. Rainbow didn't make it. Rainbow didn't why are we playing this? Rainbow didn't make it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. So easy. Fall loose. Escalator. Where's the escalator? Game should be called it should be called Tower of Fall. 
How about Power of Sadness? All right. You guys are going to hate this. Are you kidding me? That is the worst. You can do it. Can I? Yes, you can. It's the dumb. It's early to give up. I can. It's the dumb cube. Okay. Dumb Cube, please don't. Cube, please. I don't understand. She did the dumb cube. She's getting her, too. Q. I'm on the cube. Cube, cube. I'm on the cube. Cube, cube. I'm on the cube. I'm on the cube. I'm on the cube. I made it. I made it past the cube. Was it because of your cube song? Tell me how. Yes, it was. You have to sing. The cube is a song. If you don't sing the cube song, it'll flip you off. Oh, cube, cube, cube. It's a cube song. You make it tedraco stage. 
What? No. I'm going to go back. What? Checkpoint counts for everyone. Are you kidding me? Yeah. We all made it. Wait, what? This is awesome. I love this game. I paid. I did. Liar. I've never hated this yellow cheese block in my life. And I love cheese. Oh, I'm so close. I can feel it. How did you not make this ball go so fast? I made it. I made it out the bath. Suckers. You stuck there. What's up there? I'm not telling you. Please tell me. I need to know. I will beat this. We'll never make it up there. We only have 46 seconds left in this cheese. I must be chill. I must embrace Namaste. Namahay. No, you're not. Namaste down a quitter. Namaste. Oh, it's working. It worked. 
Finally. With only 8 seconds left. Now I'm crying inside. A little too late. I lunar. Wow. No. I have to go faster. Nobody gets double jump. Easy. It's not. Look. Now I'm being selfish. No, I'm Daisy. What? What are you going to do? Hey, where's our game passage? Everyone, I've just discovered I can buy triple whatever this currency is. 1000 times jump. Please. I'm buying something so I don't no. Okay. I'm buying it. No. Is that shield? Is that extra health? You can't buy it. You can't buy it. Okay, possibly. Oh, you buy it. Yeah. Look at this. Is that invincibility? Oh, yeah. Look at us. We're so pro. Oh my gosh. Whoa. Look how crazy good we are. 
Wait. We're going in circles. Rainbow, you're leading me in a loop. Yeah. Don't follow me. Finally, I can beat the tower. Oh, I just fell with invincibility. Me too. You know what? This proves? That even if you have no skill and you pay to win, you still can't beat it. You still can't beat it. This is amazing. I feel like happy inside. Going in circles, rainbows, because you're really good at parkour. Wait, does this hurt? It doesn't hurt me. This is amazing. No. Still sleeping. Still suck. No. Okay, watch this. One, two oh my. My real skill here is that we managed to still not get up that high. Let's go. 
This red level shouldn't be that hard because we have invincibility. How are we still best? I'm making it the yellow. Chuck, look at me. Look at what I found or brought. It's a travel. It lets me make my own path. Watch as I just walk. What? I ran out of path. It only let me make one. Okay, Draco, I'm going to race you. Let's go. Okay, look at my second item. This grappling hook. Why did he keep buying stuff with this grappling hook? I will just ha. No. Let me up, please. No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Dracos, can you be quiet? I'm trying to concentrate up here. And you're being extra annoying. How? Cubes. I keep falling down. Cubes. Cubes like traps abilities. 
There is no way we would make it through this. Look, I'm trying to practice factory of doom all around. The next one looks really easy. Guys, the gray level. I'm about to beat it. Yeah, look. I'm still practicing. Not that bumps us stuff. Oh, I would have died. I'm going to cheat a little bit. You know what? We're just going to stop it all. Just a little bit. Just a little bit. No. Stop talking. Oh, you should reset. No. Draco, you're so distracting. I'm trying to climb the tower. Please. I am trying to climb the tower. Please, please be quiet. Please. We bought all of these shields and we spoke. They laugh at us. Oh my God. I know. I have to beat them. Feel everyone laughing in the comment section. 
Be shutting up now. Do not put a laughing emoji in the comment. We will know what it means and we will be very hurt. No, I'm just kidding. We're going to laugh too. I think. I did it. I did it. Wow. Congrats. No cheats required. Totally would have beaten it. Required. It looks like Drac was trying to crawl up here. Drac, were you gonna make it? Yes. Watch out. Don't slip. I got to the yellow level. Wait, are you trying to beat me? SUP. I'm out. I have beaten it. I never knew what the top of the tower looks like. I got a badge. This is newbie. I should say cheetah because you didn't beat it properly. No cheats this time. Play legit. Yes. We only have double jump. The time is in our favor. Oh, this is easy. This is easy. Look at this. Where the whole crew can beat it. 
Yes, I think so. Wiggles, I have a present for you. Look at this, look at this. I got luck. Don't touch me. Time is ticket. This is my farthest that I've gone. How did you do this? I think you did. Oh, you fall down. It's funny's. Worst enemy up here. What is it? The cheese block again. If it's the cheese block, I'm going to cry. No. The Cheese Block is back. No. Cheese block. Cheese Block. Whoo. Cheese Block. Cheese Block. Block made it. No, please. Dude, the cheese block goes faster. You didn't sing the Cheese block song. Cheese block is amazing. There, worked. Delicious cheese. How about every time you die, you disconnect? When you sing to it, it doesn't move at all. No, please. Oh my God. I want to buy some invincibility. 
Did I make it? Yes, Rainbow, you have made it. Welcome, worst enemy. Lunar didn't make it. The blocking of the cheesy cheese funny. Where did you go? How did you do that? I'm a wizard. Cheese. Cheese. There you go. No. She never had a chance. Guys. Oh, hi, Draco. Hello. Hello. What are you doing up in this? Don't walk. It looks fine. Please. Look at his skill. Yes. Are you kidding me? Oh, my gosh. My hair is going to get cinched. Oh, I made it. Okay, we just got to wait for the path. Like Draco, you guys are actually pros now. You didn't even need any shields. But we do have double jump on Draco house. Double jumps doing for you. Double jump is amazing. You jinxed me. Okay, I got this. It's a simple jump. OOH. Almost died. 
What is that noise? Draco. What could have no. I can't let funny beat me. Not to get out of my dragon. You're so annoying. You're making me lose. Okay? Concentration. Don't let Funny beat me. Hi, station. I feel like that's going to be your next this is my master. Wow. You're so good. Are you kidding me? You're so good. Funny show. At least no one's at the green level. If you're at the green level, that's kind of sad and we have to cry for you. It's not moving. Okay? I'm making it to the cubes. The cheese block is nice. The cheese block is evil. Rainbow, you will always die. Cheese. Save my checkpoint. No. 
The checkpoint. Hey, guys, I'm almost catching up. Are you scared? Are you impressed? You should be scared, Rainbow. Why? This next one isn't so easy as you expect it to be. Because there is a rotating thing. Okay? You guys are like, okay, skip that. I'm going to go up here. Oh, you jinxed me funny. While you yelling. You're the one that keeps saying okay. No one was able to hear that. Daglo. Yeah. Drago is the only one talking. And then he's like, you're extracting. I'm trying to concentrate. I'm trying to beat you. Oh, my gosh. Great. Now lunar is here. Now we have a third person. Now all of us are dying. 
All of a sudden. We're doing very bad at this race. Oh, my gosh. Okay, bodies are just falling. I got this. Go, Draco. Anyone's going to beat this, it will be me. Draco. I made it. I saw it. I could have made it, too, if Draco wasn't annoying me. All right, I'm just going to touch the door so your guys are suffering. Can no. Quicker. No, please. I'm about to beat it. No, no. Draco, I have two minutes. You got times two. Speed. Okay, you know what, Andy? Speed up. Looks like it's the end of the line for Funny. Why should I say the end of the cube? Because the end of the line for me does a cube end. I just bought this. It's totally not a waste of money. 
Wait, what was this? Oh, gosh. I like how we're just staying where she is. She's like, I'll just stay here. Okay, whatever. Let's just go. It's a fresh blue box. We starting off with blue. First time I say, boss battle. Boss battle. Buy some of this. Oh, what? Then what happened? Whoa. It's a big stage. It's big. Oh, that's what it's negative. Who did this? What are you doing? Stop it. Stop extending it. Why? We blue, people. I'm green. I'm green. Foggy. Oh, Funny. No worries. She's eight, docs. Because jacko beat. Wait. What if I turn my graphic settings all the way down? I got this. I gave you bonus. 
Invincible green. I like this. I look cute red. This is impossible. Wait. How's funny at yellow. What is she doing? She's passing. You take me up there with you. No. Deserved it. This is a weird place. Shortcuts in life. I can't see anything. You. Why would you do this. You know what? I'm going to buy invisibility for everyone too. Why? That makes it worse. Why did you do that? Is this a prank? Funny prank. See anything? What the heck funny? The tower now looks like a watermelon. I love it. I have a trowel. Don't worry. I will build up to the top. Everyone. If everyone waits one block. 
What? Just one wait. It just disappeared. You wasted it. That was the money well spent. Get out of the way. No. I don't even know what this thing oh. Oops. You're doing it the hard way. You can just do this. Why do what they're doing when you can do this? One easy trick to the tower of hell. I'll show you with this one easy trick. That was cool. One easy trick. Oh, that was cool. Okay, more hacks. More hacks. Hacks with Draco. One easy one easy trick. So all you're going to have to do is you just jump over here. You jump over here. But you got to also make sure you wasted. Robust. It worked. Oh, it's no lie. This has to be the most fastest blade ever. That's a watermelon cutter. Watermelon cutter is intense. I just need to make sure. 
Oh, no. Please. No. Life. Hey. You made it to the checkpoint. Nice. It's easy that's the watermelon flipper everything's watermelon tea. Okay. In order to become the master of this tower, you must be chill. Just like me. And then therefore, you will tackle isn't chill. That's why he's not winning. But clearly I'm chill. Where's the wall? Wait a minute. Oh my gosh. Why did so much people request us to play this game? That wasn't a bit of because they wanted us to suffer. Because they know. Good news, everyone. The second pink one is the same from the bottom. 
Hashtag. No. I didn't make I don't want to keep falling. Why do I keep falling? No funny. Stop talking. Stop. You're making you stop talking. Please. Oh, this is what happens when you try to rush things. We only got four minutes. I don't worry. I'll pay. I'll pay for extra time. Thank you. That can be funny. Ha. No. You're not going to beat me. The race is on. Draco. You're just dead. Just stop screaming so you can decide. You won't beat it because I added another room. What? Wait. Draco, you just added a room to the bottom floor. No. I'm the only one that suffers. 
You jerk. I found a cheat. I found a cheat. I just cheated. What? No. Shoot. Welcome to the factory. Oh, you left? Okay, bye. Yeah. I don't want to be here. I renowned me as queen of cheating and my suffering. Draco, you better be careful. You did this. You little cheat. Better be careful. Draco. Draco, come on. You won't regret. I gave you all speed. Annoying. I gave you all speed. Speed is not out. Speed makes it worse. Oh, speed makes it worse. I didn't know that. If you did, you know what you did. No, I didn't. Isn't me. Is getting foggy. Oh, my gosh. I'm going to get mad. How dare you? 
This is just amazing to watch. I'm just dying now. It's okay. I'll give you all invincibility. She lied. I saw no invincible. Oh, Draco is getting too close to me. Oh, my God. You body hawking us. Why? I hate you. Because I need to win. Draco. This is Tower of Trigger. That's what this should be. How about Tower of being annoying? I did it. What's the point of doing this when you can't even see us? Tower of Trigger. Yeah, I should put the fog last out. Hello. I am back on the ground. Never, never again.

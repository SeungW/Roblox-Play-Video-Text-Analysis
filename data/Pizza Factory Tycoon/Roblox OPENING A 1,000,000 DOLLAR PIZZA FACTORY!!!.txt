Hey, guys. Jen what's happening, dude? And welcome back to another roadblock video. We just played superhero training simulator, and I can't even move now. We're going so slow now. I don't like it. I know. I feel like I'm, like, crawling. And guys, I'm Super paul for today, we found a two player Tycoon. We finally get to work together. Yeah. You don't have to just stand there and watch me. Honestly, it makes me sad. Okay, so is this like what do we do? We have to claim it. Okay, so I'll do this one. All right. I was waiting for you to pick that color. All right, so start making pizzas by clicking on this. Okay, so we are going to become pizza men and women. And women. Yes. Wait, look. Come over here. What is that? Look, the pizza is coming out. Why is it so tiny? Look, it's one slice. That's disgusting. Wait, so we don't even make the whole oh, my God. It's going directly into the truck. 

Why is it not, like, on something? I feel like these games are so not sanitary. Jed this is our pizza factory. No, it's so not hygienic. We decided that code. It's way cheaper. It's just going in the dirty truck. Wait, check this one out over here. Look, this one's full pizzas. Oh, they look like mini pizzas. Maybe. Okay, so right now I have $340. Oh, wait, you do? Okay, so I'm going to purchase another pizza slice. I have 1000. What? What do you mean? Wait, my side makes money and your side makes some money, but mine makes more. Oh, my God. That's amazing. Why don't you buy us some stuff? Like, buy us some walls. Wait. No, I'm curious. Is more pizza coming out now? I think my side is broken. No, because you're getting money from the pizza slices. Why are you getting full pizzas and I'm just getting little slices? Because my side is better than yours. So you're getting two kinds of pizza slices now? Yes. All right, so should I get the whole pizza? 

Okay, do it. All right, so check it out. Look at that. Look at this. Look at it. Jen oh, my gosh. Wait, now they're on pizza boxes. Okay. Now it's hyjen. Eh. Okay. Your side is so much better. All right. Maybe you should, you know, get some red spice. That sounds disgusting. Okay, it's $300 for this red spice. All right, so what does that look like? EW, it's disgusting. Wait, I don't know if I want to be in business with you. About $1,500 I've made. Okay. Everything's so expensive on my side, too. It's 4500 for mixed pizza with spices. Is it really? Yes. I'm so sorry. You know, I'll buy the walls. Okay. All right. I don't know if you can. Oh, only I can buy stuff on this side. There's, like, nothing for you to buy. And you have all this money? No, I got to get the purchase the box pizza. Look at my own oven. Oh, I bought the conveyor walls. It looks a little nicer now. Oh, check out my oven over here. 

Jad, it's really cool. I want to purchase some walls. Oh, so I have other pizzas coming out of the oven. Brick oven. Oh, do you want to ride it? I'm, like, super jealous. How come inside it's so bad compared to mine? Look, you can ride it into the truck. Oh, I'm a pizza. Oh, God, I'm trapped. Oh, God, I'm trapped. What's happening? I can't get out of the truck. Oh, God, no. Jack. Come over and kill me. Wait, hold on. I'm buying stuff. Okay, I'm purchasing some more wall. All right, you have a sword, right? Yes, I do. Okay, I'll come. All right, come and kill me. Wait, I don't want to get stuck in there too. All right, get out. Am I dead? Okay, you died. You're back now. All right, wait. It's sweet. And how much money do I have? All right, so I have 1200. I bought us some walls. Oh, I got 4600. Okay. Can I buy it? I'm going to buy myself a door so no one can come in here. Oh, I got my door too, so now we're safe in here. Okay, good. Do you want me to purchase us a path? 

Oh, some carpet. That's nice. Fancy in here. So it costs more money for my stuff, but I'm the one that has to buy the second floor for us. Oh, okay. All right, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to get us more box pizza over here. Oh, no, I need 4500. Let me go get my money. I bought the green spice. EW, is it green? EW, yours is so nasty. All right, I have how much money do I have? I've got 5400. Oh, I'm getting more box pizza for us. So I've got another oven baking, perfectly fresh pizzas. All right, do I make a good pizza lady? No. I feel like I'm horrible at it. Like, you have the grossest stuff ever. Oh, man, it's so nasty. Jen, why is your site so much grosser? I could buy the pizza delivering scooter. 7000, though. All right, let me see. I've got $3,500 to grab. All right, the next thing I need to buy is $4,500. Okay, so what should I get? 

Do you want me to get the next floor next, or do you want me to get a delivery scooter? Buy oh, you buy the delivery scooter. Okay, I'll buy this one. Apparently, you both can get delivery scooters for 7000, but you don't want to waste your money. I want to waste it. So just buy one for your side. I can probably still use it, right? I think so, because we're working together. I've got 7000. All right, go buy that delivery scooter. Where's the scooter? How does it work? Wait, what is this? Wait, where's my scooter? I don't know, I'm still confused. This isn't a scooter. Wait. Oh, we're selling them. Oh, I think I got it. Let me explain. Okay. We're a pizza factory and we're giving this to all the pizza places. Wait, do we make scooters and pizza? Yeah, we make pizza and we make scooters so they could deliver them to the neighborhood. Wait, let me see if I get on it. Oh my God, no, you can't. This is so weird. You're right, this is not hygienic. 

So we're having pizza slices, full pieces. The boxes are open, by the way. It gets shut down. And then we have scooters, just dirty old oily scooters. My pieces, they're not even in boxes. The spices are just like separate. I know, it's actually wonderful. Oh, wait, want me to get the second floor? Okay, so I just bought something that was 4500. Oh, I got another little oven. Oh, look, we got stairs to the second floor now. Okay. All right, so you still can purchase more scooters. I think you actually should because I think you'll get money when you sell the scooters. First I want to purchase more walls. Oh, good idea. All right, I did that. Oh, I can purchase life even more. OOH, look how bright it is now. All right, now we just need one last wall. It's 4000. Oh, it's so much brighter in here. I know, it looks so much better, doesn't it? This place is so much better now. All right, so I'm going to get supporters. Oh, my God. It's epic. Jen, check this out. There's pizzas decorated into the supporters of the wall. 

Oh my God, I love it. Wait, you have a lot of stuff to buy upstairs. All right. Okay, so you want me to handle that stuff and you kind of work on this? Yes. All right, so I have $3,400. I purchased this random pizzas. Oh, wait, that sounds cool. Oh, mom, at least our place looks cute. Oh, do you notice there's a oh my God, there's so many. There's a pile of them under here. So when people want pizza, real pizza, those are a dollar 99. Enjoy, everybody. All right, so we're getting some serious money. Wait, you have a lot of money now, don't you? I have tons. You have 18,000. Okay, I'm going to purchase the last wall. Oh, it's looking nice. And then let me buy the scooter. Oh, this is actually really sweet. All right, the whole downstairs is done, I think. All right. Okay, so there's another path and more conveyor belts we can do up here. Okay. All right, so hopefully you'll get full pizzas. All right, so is there only two flowers looking at other someone in here? Oh, yeah. 

Oh, he's evil. Get your sword. Okay. Oh my gosh, no, he killed me. I'll protect you. Oh my God, he killed us. We need Wald. Oh, wait, that's what we have to work on. That's the first thing we need. Okay, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get my money and I'm gonna buy walls. Okay? That's what I'm gonna do too. We have to protect the place. Get your sword out. I'm kind of scared. Is he up here? He's probably up here. No, he left. Okay, buy a wall quick. All right, where are the walls? Right here. 15,000. Oh, okay, I'm going to buy more walls. I can't afford them. Wait, I've got something better. 30,000. We can buy a weapon stand. How much money do you have? I've got 14,000. Okay. Oh, I'm adding a second conveyor belt so we can start making more pizzas. All right, let me see what I can buy here. All right, let me get my money. I got 5000 more. Okay, so right now I have 6000. I can't really afford anything. Oh, but, Jen, did you see this? We can get an ultra pizza machine for 10,000. Oh, buy that next. All right, wait, let's check it out. Oh, my God. It looks amazing. All right, let's see what it comes out as. 

Please don't be a square. Wait, the advanced pizza machine is 15,000. Oh, look, it's a little pizza. Oh, they're like gourmet pizza. He's back. Oh, God. Kill him. Protect the pizzas. Oh, my God. That guy is insane. All right, we have to buy the weapons band. Okay, we also need the walls. But everything's so expensive. All right. Okay, I've got 16,000, and I've got 13,000. Are you up here? Okay, should I buy the walls, or should I just buy the pizza machine? Get the pizza machine because we're going to get he's here, he's here. All right. No, we have to get okay, I'm going to spend my money on the weapon thing. Okay. Oh, God, he's in our space. Okay, kill him. Our weapon's horrible. I killed him. Okay, good. Maybe he won't come back. Or he'll come back because he's really mad right now. All right, let me get the weapons. Eggs. All right, I have 12,000. I can't afford anything. Wait, come over here. Jen, this weapon sand is 20,000. I have 20,000. 

Okay. Oh, no, we we don't have the weapons yet. What? You still need to buy more stuff. I just have to stand for it. No, that's such a rip off. I know. Oh, man. We need walls and stuff. Okay, so right now, Jen, by the wall. I could buy the wall. This is like, the most pathetic wall I've ever seen in my life. That is not going to protect us. 17,000. 17,000, nothing. An inch of wall. Okay, I've got 10,000 more dollars. All right, I think I built that myself. All right, I've got 11,000. I need 15,000 for the advanced pizza machine. The next wall is 25,000. I think we just have to go with the pizza machines and stuff. Okay. Oh, no. What do we do? Wait, I'm gonna get this. I think he's scared now. He's not coming back. Okay, I can't buy the stuff on this side. I can only buy the yellow stuff. I'm gonna go get more money. All right. That's what I'm doing. All right. I'm trying to save my money right now because I can't afford anything. I think we actually intimidated that guy. I think so too. Alright, I want to check out you want to check out the advanced pizza machine? 

Okay. Yeah, I'm coming. Oh, you have enough money to buy one too. Oh, okay. We'll both buy one. There's no pizzas coming out on my side. Oh, yeah, there is. Okay, so now we should have even better pizzas coming out of this middle one. I'm waiting for pizzas. Oh, he's back. Get him. Are we sure that's him? I think that's someone else. Why is everyone coming into our place? No, I think that's him. Oh, man. All right, we need to protect it. Jen, the balls are still much money. No, I don't have enough money. We keep buying more pizzas. Okay, so what do we need right now? All right. Okay. We could get a bridge. Can we just buy some money? No, we can't do that. I've got 16,000 of 12,000. Yeah, 12,000. All right, so will you do me the honor of riding this bad with me? Of course I will. All right, hop on. We're going to the truck. That would be style. We're probably going to get stuck in the truck. 

Don't get yourself stuck. All right? We're doing our dirty feet. We're contaminating everything. No, it's fine. Oh, Joe, you could buy Magic Spice here for 10,000. Oh, okay. Oh, look at it. It's gorgeous. Oh, I bet that makes everything worth so much more money. I hope so. We need a lot of money. All right, I'm going to go. Oh, I got 25. We both have 25,000 waiting for us. Okay, let's go buy stuff right now. All right. Do we do walls? Oh, he's here. All right, get your weapon ready. What is wrong with his birthday? All right, what do we do? I don't know. Let's just intimidate him. All right. Okay. Kill the guy. Kill him. Okay. Yeah, we need to get him. I'm dead. All right. I don't know what to do. Okay, we need the walls, like, ASAP. All right, get the walls. I'm going to get more money. Is he still here, though? I don't want to close them in. Oh, God, that would be bad. I've got 60,000. Okay, is he here? All right, so you're the one that has to buy the walls, though. They're on your side. I'm buying the walls. Okay. 

All right, now I just need to buy some windows. The windows, they're 16,000. Okay. All right, get those. I could purchase ladders. Okay, do that. It doesn't help us at all. All right, wait, so can he still get in? We need like a roof on there. All right, you have 16,000 oh, I'm going to get the bridge. Oh, okay. Oh, so I have a little bridge so we don't have to, like, contaminate everything. I have 39,000. Or I could purchase more walls. Or I've got 42,000. Let's go back up there. Let's try to make this place a little bit better. Okay, I'm buying these walls. The third floor. Oh, no. Oh, wait, that's good, because that will get, like, a roof on there. Okay, so you need 35. Why do I have to buy everything? It's really funny. I'm going to upgrade my advanced pizza machine right now. Okay. So that's going to make it a little bit better. So I have more money. All right. I'm going to buy the third floor. I have 51,000. All right, I've got 55,000. Okay. I think we're doing really good. Once we get some weapons and stuff, we're going to be epic. 

Okay, the third floor is here. We really need to buy the roof. How do we get to the third floor? All right, so we climb up the ladder. All right. Oh, my God. This stuff's really expensive, Jen. Oh, my God. Oh, we get a couch. Wait, where do we get the roof? I think we have to purchase the other stuff first. Oh, man. Okay, I've got 42,000 more over here so I can keep upgrading. I think the place is looking really sweet, though, isn't it? Let me get some more money. All right, so I've got 70,000 pizza machine upgrade and then another pizza machine upgrade over here. I'm getting all kinds of pizzas now. And then I'll buy this. Yeah, I say we need to work on these, because if we work on those, we'll just get so much more money, so much quicker. Bought ourselves a nice bridge. Oh, I can buy a package stand. Oh, what's that even look like? I have no idea. Oh, the stamina package. Oh, okay. I'm going to work on the other side where we can get the weapons. Okay. Because we really need them if we want to defend from these people. 

All right. Oh, no, is he back? I got coil gear, x's magic carpet gear. Okay. I think I'm stuck. I got myself stuck. Okay, don't worry. It's fine. You want me to kill you? No, it's good, it's good.

All right, let me upgrade my machinery over here. I'm going to buy this. Oh, Jen, do you want couches? Yes. Look, we can sit down as we watch our pizza. This is nice. All right. I'm actually really happy about that. I need some more money. 41,000, quickly now. I know. It's actually working out perfectly. I feel like they balanced this really good. All right, so I'm going to go buy this samurai thing. Over here. Oh, do you think there'll be armor, like, weapons with it? Oh, look, there's armor. Okay, let me get that. 

How do you get it? I want this. How do I become it? I think he's coming. Oh, I'm a samurai now. How did you do it? You just go into it, like, a lot and jump into it until you become it. Oh, my God. Oh, we look cool now. We look amazing. The thing is, we need to get weapons. Okay, yeah, we definitely need weapons. Is that in your side? All right, I'm stuck in the pizza machine. That's what happened to me before. Oh, God. All right, I'm out. Okay, so, yeah, I'm going to try to get us some weapons. I have 80,000. Oh, okay, that's you. I got nervous. I thought someone was in here. So I can buy us a magic carpet next. I'm hoping that after that, it's going to be, like, actual weapons that we could use because it's really not helping us fight people. All right, next up, gun gear. Oh, I can afford it. Oh, yes, Chad. We have a rainbow gun to fight with. Oh, my God. Yes. Oh, my God. It's a laser beam. Wait, okay, let me get it. We can get a magic carpet and we can go to people and we can kill them. This is perfect. All right, anyone comes in, I hope that guy comes back here.

I've got it now. So much brighter now. I could barely see anything before. If you walked into a pizza shop and the owner looked like this, would you even want to get pizza there? Wait, I didn't even think about that. Is that why we have no customers? I think it is. Oh, my God. We have so much money. Oh, my God. We're going to be able to buy everything. All right.

All right, we're safe. They'll get the walk speed pad. Walk speed path. Wait, so now we can walk quicker? Oh, okay. I bought another one. All right, this is actually really nice. Oh, jump power. We can buy too, but we need to go get more money. Can you afford the shade? I can't afford anything right now. Let's go back down. All right, we need to get down here. Everything is so much quicker. Oh, we have so much money. All right, I've got another 560,000. All right, let's go back up here. I feel like you'd be really slow with that armor on. Yes. Oh, man, this is so epic. I buy the work clock shades.

Oh, this gives us bonus health. Oh, my God. Wait, if we have this, no one's going to be able to kill us. Do you jump on them. Wait, what is this, the visor? Yeah, it's like, really cool. Look at that tongue you got going on. All right, so Jen, get on those pads so you get the bonus health. Okay, so let me get lock, speed, jump power, and the 500 health. All right, so we feed up all of that and do we finish the whole place? We're invincible and we finished. Go kill someone. All right. Okay, we're going right now. Okay, let's go.

So make sure you get everything. All right, let me get all these first and then go get some armor and weapons and I'll be ready to go. Okay. Oh, I couldn't put this on before. Oh, yeah, get your face, your hat, whatever you want to wear. Okay, so let me go over to this side. I want to get definitely the motorcycle. Oh, no, I'm going to get the golden thing. I can't go down the ladder. All I got the golden katana and I'm going to get the beautiful armor once again, and we are going to kill some people. You're ready, Jad? Yes, I'm ready. All right. Have to go up my side. Okay, here we go. All right, get on something. Oh, okay. Are you ready? This is open. Oh, my God. There's open. Okay, let's just get off and go in. Okay.

The battle's up. I got her. We might die. I got her, I got her. 

Oh, he killed me. Finish him. Okay. I may have killed you. Actually, that's probably what happened. Oh, man. So we took down that group. I have to go get a new weapon now. I'm going on my own. All right, I'll meet you there. I'm looking for open doors, you know, that we could kind of fly in if we get the magic carpet, if they don't have a ceiling on the third floor. I'm not going to kill the poor people that are just walking around. Well, I'm going to oh, no, they closed their door. We can't go in now. Oh, no, we could fly in. We get our magic. Oh, isn't there like a coil, too, so we could jump? No, you could just jump really high. Oh, because we have the jump booth. We have the jump booth. Oh, that's so overpowered. It's ridiculous. All right, I'm coming. I'm killing them again. I feel kind of bad about this. I'm coming. Where. Are you? I'm in their place. Just jump in. Oh, wait, so you just jumped into the place where I got the coil so I can jump really high? Hello, everybody. Okay. Oh, they bought a stairway. All right, why don't we go get somebody else dad? Okay, so why don't we go over here? 

Wait, did you see the size of our plate? It's actually huge. Let's go. Let's jump over here. I'm coming to this. Hello, sir. Oh, no, he just smiled too, and then I killed him. Wait, Tim, I'm sorry. Hello, sir. Nice to meet you. Map do this. Map do it once it wears off. Wait. What am I doing? Are you typing to him? Yes. All right, there's another group of people over here that just started. Hello. Oh, hello there. Don't kill me, Chad. Oh, man, I feel like we're so powerful now. So did you see this, though? How big is our pizza place now? Wait, I didn't realize. Ours is, like, so much better than everyone. I think the other people left. The guy that was killing us before. He probably finished and then logged off. Yes, I think that's what happened. All right, ready to battle? Okay. Where are you? Wait, why are you naked? I don't need armor. Okay, here we go. All right, ready? Think you could take me out, Jen? 

You think you could take me out? Oh, no, wait. Oh, God. Double Teamr. Oh, God. You killed that girl, lady. Oh, man. Oh, man. Wait, we have so much health. Oh, you're going down. You're going to die. I'm going to get you, Jen. Am I hurting you at all? Wait, is my health down? I don't know. Is it? Can you see my health bar? Wait. We literally can't even hurt each other right now. My first attempt, obviously. Guys, I won. Wait, she messed with us and she just died. That is so sad. Anyways, guys, we are going to end that here.

Welcome back to the Valentina Diva semifinal. This season Valentina Diva fashion show is sure to be one to remember. We've got big name models running the show, right? Co seems to be clear. The next supermodels this is my chance. And go. Is that Sophia Cassidy? Let's Jeff her for an interview. Oh, no. Hurry, sophia, sweetie crouched out. Oh, my gosh. That was way too close. So I saw the news. One of the next Valentina Divas is standing right in front of me. 

Yeah, I was going to talk to you about that. What do you have to talk about? Do it. Mom, this is going to be a huge milestone in your career. And do know what this means? This means I'm going to be in Paris for months of brutal fitness training, dealing with the drama of doring with those peppy youngsters. And what am I supposed to do with you? I can come with you and hide like a bat in the limo for eight months. They're going to find you. And once they find you, they'll do the math. And I already lie about my age enough. I'll lose everything I've ever worked for. No, Mom, I can hide. Really? Besides, you're almost 15. If you were living a normal life, you'd be entering high school this fall. What if you could? But no one knows about me. 

Who would just suddenly take me in like some abandoned puppy? There is one person that knows about me. How? I can't believe I have to do this. What do you want this time? Melissa? Hey. I heard you got your cafe up and running recently. Mom, you're crazy. You make so many decisions without even thinking it through. You need me. I need you? I've lived my whole life with you. How am I supposed to leave you so suddenly? Trust me on this, okay? You always say that. Remember that time I trusted you when you said tanning with sunglasses would be a good idea? Don't remind me of my inverted panda phase. 

Call me every night. You've got high demand. Supermodel Sofia Cassidy on the line, so you better pick up. Yeah, I ain't gone all day. Time for my beautiful Amber to take on the world. I'm coming, I'm coming. Bye, mom. Bye, sweetie. Is this really the start of my new life? No more hiding, no more sleeping in the limo. A normal life? My new life begins in the attic of all Melissa's Cafe. I've spent my whole life reading books and writing stories about teenagers in high school. How hard could it be? I hate to love you so I love to hate you. 

OOH. It's the first day of school for kids around the nation, including here in Sunny Scabbies. So bug love kids, and get ready to OMG. Luke Brown is posted. Clear your legs. Wait. Notice me. Luke shadowgirl seven live streaming. And that's tonight. But for now pete, what am I supposed to do? On the first day. Phone door. My lovely shelter. Come along. There. Get in. 

Silly. So according to the books I've read, there's supposed to be a bus. Is it that smelly thing? They weren't kidding when they said Skyview kids were either super smart seriously, it's a question. Asking distance or displacement. I took the integral of the app or super rich. Oh my God. I love your outfit. No, yours. I love my outfit. Please. What? Hey. What? Isn't that him? I still remember the first time I saw him. What's? Your writing over there. Oh, sorry. Let me. 

No way. You read Harold Porter? This is only my 8th time rereading it. Wow, more than me? I thought only nerds like me reread books that often. You calling me a nerd? Nothing wrong with that. Well, I'm proud of it. Anyways, I just like a small iced coffee, please. Coming right up. But seriously, what were you writing? Well, it's a short story I've been working on. Mind if I read it a bit? No one has ever read my work, but sure. This was great. I do think Joe needs a bit more character development, though. Thanks for the feedback. 

Have I really been the only one who's ever read your work? Yeah. You should enter these into contests. I think you do really well. Really? Oh my. I'm running late. It got carried away. Thanks for the coffee. Bye. Wow, did I just make a friend? She came to the cafe several times each week. It was nice having a conversation with someone other than my mom and aunt. Wait, is he with her? Who messed up my latte incompetence? Where's my first cause? Anyway, I better a hurry. Come on, Amber, think. 

What do normal people do? Hi, I'm Amber. I thought humans responded to each other. Here we go, ma'am. But no time to go back in line. I can probably still eat it, right? Where's the private lima when you need one? Where do I sit? The movies always made making friends seem so easy. But here I was, so lonely in this crowded lunchroom. So I decided to go somewhere less crowded. Because if I was lonely, at least I'd be lonely by myself. Nice salad. 

Wait. I'm sorry if I scared you. Are you eating? Yes. Hey, me too. Do you want to eat together? Well, it's just me here, so why not? Also, I think someone just had to hear you in here. So we should leave. Oh, yeah. Let's head out. Oh, by the way, I'm Amber. Sorry. I've never been to a real school before. High school. I can tell. I'm Claire. I can help you navigate high school. Nice to meet someone decent around here. That's her, right? Excuse me, do I know you? 

Oh, I'm just a bit dazed. Sorry. By the way, in high school, you shouldn't stare at people for that long. Oh, I see. So she doesn't remember me. Can't blame her. I've only ever known my mom my entire life. So ever since working at the cafe, I've literally remembered every face I met. Whereas she's probably lived a whole life with stories of her own, while all I've had were stories of other people. I can't believe Lucas didn't reply to your text yet. Who does he think he is? Am I not good enough? Not good enough? Honey, you are gorgeous, rich, and have a fastbuster fame because of your dad. 

Don't ever think that one day you'll even be as big as Sofia. I'm going to defeat the entrepreneur and martyr tonight. Woo. Look at those geek gamers rotting their brains and socialize at the same time. Amber, how was your first day at school? It was fine. I made a friend. I knew you could do it. Humans aren't so scary after all, right? They kind of are. Especially high schoolers. Are you sure you still want to work here during school? Yes, I'll just do homework during downtimes. You know, it's nice having you around at the cafe. Aunt Melissa never had a family of her own, but found one through the Galaxy cafe. 

I love it here. For the first time, I don't have to hide from everyone. The people here give me ideas for my own stories. I wonder if he's coming today. Are you guys still opening?
